excerpt: n this book, Julius Evola analyses the Fascist movement of Italy, which he
  himself had experienced first-hand, often as a vocal critic, throughout its entire
  history from 1922 until 1945. Discussing - and dismissing - the misuse of the term
  'fascism' that has gained widespread acceptance, Evola asks readers not to allow
  the fact of Italy's defeat in the Second World War to distract us from making an
  objective analysis of the ideology of Fascism itself, since the defeat was the result
  of contingent circumstances and the personalities of those who led it, rather than
  flaws that were inherent in Fascism as an idea.
