excerpt: New Culture, New Right is the first English-language study of the identitarian
  movements presently reshaping the contours of European politics. The study's focus
  is Alain de Benoist's GRECE (Groupement de Recherche et d'Etude pour la Civilisation
  Europ√©enne), which Paul Piccone of Telos described as the most interesting group
  of continental thinkers since the existentialists of the 1950s and which elsewhere
  is seen as the leading school of contemporary Right-wing thought.
