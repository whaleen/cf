excerpt: No one who reads this all-encompassing study of the American predicament
  will ever again view his country and himself in the same light. The author brilliantly
  recounts the tragedy of a great people, the Americans of European descent, who founded
  and built The United States and whose decline is the chief cause of America's decline.
  Although replete with cogent criticism of the people and events which have brought
  America low, the book ends on a positive, optimistic note, which envisions a resurgent
  American Majority liberating its institutions from the control of intolerant intellectuals
  innately programmed to destroy what they could never create. Over 150,000 copies
  sold. -Howard Allen Inc Publications
