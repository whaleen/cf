excerpt: Thirteen-year-old Leland Pefley was minding his own business, enjoying a
  day's fishing near his father's farm in Tennessee, when the odd, well-dressed and
  well-spoken man from the city appeared, inviting Lee to accompany him to a more
  interesting place. Out of curiosity, Lee followed him, and found himself hustled
  off to a strange, rustic academy in the wilderness with a group of other boys, all
  of whom had been semi-abducted as he himself had been. None of them knew why they
  were there. Some believed they had been brought there to be murdered, or worse.
