<p>The trolls have come home to roost. Decades after the hippies and Alinsky-ites began deconstructing our country and marching through its institutions in order to destroy them from within, people on the right wing have begun to use the same tactics that the Left used to destroy America, in an attempt to destroy the Left.</p>
<p>James O’Keefe already has a long history of going after and destroying the Left. <a href="http://projectveritas.com/acorn/">His 2009 takedown of a key Democratic get-out-the-vote organization, ACORN, bore real political fruit.</a> GOTV organizations like ACORN are some of the indispensable legs that bear up the political throne the Left sits on. Take out the legs of that throne, and the Left will collapse.</p>
<p>He has again targeted one of the legs of that throne — the media. <a href="http://faithandheritage.com/2017/02/enemies-of-the-american-people/">I wrote recently about how liberal media outlets are, as President Trump recently said, “the enemies of the American people.”</a> O’Keefe obtained hundreds of hours of recordings from within CNN headquarters in Atlanta. <a href="http://cnnleaks.com/">O’Keefe posted the recordings</a> without transcribing all of them. But the bits that he already had transcribed show the scalawags and carpetbaggers who infest Ted Turner’s propaganda empire revealing their heartfelt bias on a constant basis.</p>
<p>If you’d like to transcribe the recordings, there might be a big payday in it for you. <a href="http://veritaslive.com/02-23-2017/project-veritas-releases-over-100-hours-of-audio-from-inside-cnn.html">O’Keefe has offered a $10,000 reward “for content which exposes media malfeasance.”</a> What exactly that means is unclear. However, just as with the wrongdoings that Julian Assange’s WikiLeaks has brought to light, undoubtedly the gross bias of CNN staff will come to light through these recordings’ transcriptions. According to O’Keefe, <a href="http://www.infowars.com/white-house-on-okeefe-cnn-leaks-so-cool/">the White House phoned to tell him that the CNN Leaks project was “so cool.”</a></p>
<p>CNN and other left wing media are denouncing O’Keefe on the basis of a settlement he reached with an ACORN employee who sued him years ago during his takedown of that organization. But that’s just a red herring. What they won’t say is “we’re sorry,” “we apologize,” “we should do better,” or “we resign” for the bias rife in their organizations. Of course, that’s always what they demand that people on the right do when they simply live their lives in a non-Marxist frame of mind.</p>
<p>The Left is going down, and they have no one to blame but themselves.</p><div class="">
