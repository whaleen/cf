<p>ESPN — which I’ve long called the <a href="https://infogalactic.com/info/List_of_Jewish_sportscasters_and_promoters">Every Semite Possible Network</a> due to <a href="http://viv-bernstein.blogspot.com/2013/07/the-merry-jews-of-nascar.html?m=1">its preponderance of Jewish sportscasters and writers</a> (spend some time at <a href="http://www.jewornotjew.com/profile.jsp?ID=434">JeworNotJew.com</a> to gape at the domination of Jewish broadcasters in sports, from Chris Berman to Dick Schaap to Rich Eisen to Steve Sabol) — is bleeding subscribers <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/espn-struggles-wont-go-away-but-disney-ceo-thinks-he-has-the-answer-2017-02-08">according to a recent report</a>. ESPN’s loss of cable subscribers has been steep and serious enough to weigh down parent company Disney’s profitability.</p>
<blockquote><p>Disney revenue fell 3% in the quarter to $14.8 billion, which was below expectations, and profit dropped 14% to $2.5 billion. Disney faced tough comparisons at its film studio and for consumer products due to the success of “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” which was released in December 2015, but ESPN was a clear sore spot. . . .</p>
<p>During the call [Disney CEO Bob] Iger fielded a lot of questions about ESPN and its planned direct-to-consumer service and distribution deals with digital multichannel video programming distributors. Analysts seem upbeat on plans to turn ESPN around, and the likelihood that Iger will extend his tenure to stick around and see it through.</p></blockquote>
<p>For months the company has denied that its declining viewership had anything to do with its support for leftist causes such as Black Lives Matter, the Colin Kaepernick protest of the national anthem, and so on. In this regard it has kept in stride with, or slightly ahead of, the sporting businesses it covers such as the NFL and NBA.</p>
<p>A random glance at ESPN’s website reveals 24/7 implicit (and sometimes explicit) bias against males, heterosexuals, whites, Christians, and conservatives. Even its own ombudsman – the guy within the company who is supposed to police the company – <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/sports/2016/11/10/espns-brady-wonders-network-liberal/">recently looked into whether or not the network had a left-wing bias</a>. Of course he danced around the question and produced an everything-is-alright account of affairs at ESPN (one of the failings of non-independent investigators), but his conclusions are hard to square with the following facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>ESPN staffers donated 80 percent of their political contributions in 2012 and 2016 to Democrats and only 20 percent to Republicans</li>
<li>ESPN bought a liberal political blog, FiveThirtyEight, which consistently opposed Trump during his campaign and predicted an easy Clinton victory, and its non-sports-related articles are on the main ESPN website</li>
<li>ESPN created TheUndefeated.com, <a href="https://theundefeated.com/features/if-you-thought-sports-were-ever-separate-from-politics-think-again/">an overtly left-wing, pro-black website dedicated to the permanent Marxist revolution</a></li>
<li>ESPN moved its ESPY Celebrity Golf Classic from Trump National Golf Club to another course in July 2016 for strictly political reasons</li>
<li><a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-st-caitlyn-jenner-courage-award-espys-20150715-story.html">ESPN awarded Bruce Caitlin “It” Jenner its highest award for athletic courage in 2015</a> despite Jenner’s being unathletic for years, and on the pretense that Jenner was “courageous” for being willing to cut off its male genitalia and dress up like a girl in public</li>
</ul>
<p>Compare these overtly left-wing, social justice warrior policies and actions with the intolerance towards three-time World Series champion pitcher Curt Schilling, who <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/social-justice/2016/04/20/social-justice-warriors-get-major-league-scalp-espn-fires-baseball-legend-curt-schilling-transgender-comments/">made a modest, sarcastic remark about the North Carolina law against transgender invasions of bathrooms and was swiftly terminated from his gig as an ESPN broadcaster</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10857" src="http://faithandheritage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Curt-Schilling-transgender-joke-ESPN-firing.jpg" alt="" width="390" height="359"></p>
<p>Keep in mind, though, that it’s not just ESPN that has been intolerant of Schilling. He has openly said that he believes if he were not an outspoken Republican, the sports writers who choose who belongs in the Baseball Hall of Fame would have already elected him. He’s been passed over five times.</p>
<p><a href="http://thebiglead.com/2017/01/31/ryen-russillo-with-trump-and-politics-i-dont-know-what-job-of-sports-talk-host-is-anymore/">Avowedly apolitical ESPN Radio show host Ryen Russillo said Jan. 31</a> that his network has moved far to the left, and that it’s made broadcasting on that platform unimaginably boring and irrelevant to actual sports.</p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t know what the job is anymore. I got into sports because I want to talk about sports, and now I feel like if I’m not doing a social awareness show three out of five days a week I feel like I’m doing it wrong. . . .</p>
<p>Like, I don’t care. I find myself going, ‘Man, this again today?’<b> </b></p></blockquote>
<p>Fox Sports Radio show host Clay Travis has <a href="http://www.outkickthecoverage.com/espn-profit-plummets-as-network-turns-left-020817">predicted that ESPN’s collapse — brought on by its shift to the far left and resonating in its balance sheets — is imminent</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Every single day this year ESPN has lost roughly 10,000 cable and satellite subscribers. . . .</p>
<p>Every single day the equivalent of a decent sized American town stops paying ESPN for content. This is the continuation of a trend that began in 2011 when ESPN peaked with 101 million cable and satellite subscribers according to Nielsen. Per Nielsen’s most recent estimates <a href="https://sportstvratings.com/how-many-more-homes-is-espn-in-than-fs1-february-2017-cable-coverage-estimates/7433/">ESPN now has 87,859,000 cable and satellite subscribers</a>. That’s a loss of over 13 million cable and satellite subscribers in the past several years, costing ESPN in the neighborhood of $1.3 billion dollars per year. ($7.30 a month in affiliate fees x 12 months x 13 million households). That’s money that will never return and that’s money that is incredibly significant when you consider that ESPN is on the hook for $7.3 billion in yearly sports rights fees, the most any company in the world is paying for content. . . .</p>
<p>Add it all up and the amounts are staggering, tens of billions of dollars in yearly fees owed regardless of what revenue looks like. With most companies you can cut costs if your revenue declines. Not ESPN. It owes these tens of billions for the next decade to come and more.</p>
<p>The result of this coming financial calamity has been panic, which has primarily manifested itself in a desperate ploy for relevance. ESPN decided to become a social justice warrior network, treating all liberal opinion makers as those worthy of promotion and casting aside all those who had the gall to challenge the new Disney world order. . . .</p>
<p>You would be astounded by how many people inside ESPN I hear from who have the absolute gall to vote Republican. Yes, they exist. And yes they are terrified of you knowing who they are. . . .</p>
<p>Conservative viewers aren’t stupid, they see exactly what’s happening.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ClayTravis/status/768471379800887296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">Even crazier, SPORTS VIEWERS ARE, ON AVERAGE, CONSERVATIVE!<i></i></a></p></blockquote>
<p>We should hope and pray that ESPN, like the other anti-Christian, anti-white, pro-degenerate media out there, does collapse into ruin, and that none arise to take their place. We should also work to establish <a href="http://faithandheritage.com/">our own media outlets</a>, <a href="http://gmwhiteamerica.com/churches/">churches</a>, business associations, financial institutions, schools, <a href="http://gmwhiteamerica.com/">and more</a> to build a Christian, pro-white civilization.</p><div class="">
