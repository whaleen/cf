<p>It’s amazing what liberals find “horrifying.” More men than women working in science and engineering fields is “<a href="http://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2013/03/science-gender-gap">horrifying</a>.” Bernie Sanders supporters not voting for Hillary is “<a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/7/1/12077846/daily-show-sanders-trump-jessica-williams">horrifying</a>.” <a href="http://www.radixjournal.com/journal/2014/11/14/the-courts-jester">John Oliver</a> thinks making fun of Anita Sarkeesian is “<a href="http://www.salon.com/2015/06/22/john_oliver_exposes_the_horrifying_world_of_online_harassment_if_you_dont_think_its_a_big_deal_congrats_on_your_white_penis/">horrifying</a>.” Making jokes about Leslie Jones (of affirmative action Ghostbusters fame) and leaking her nude photos is <a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/781208/leslie-jones-horrifying-twitter-experience-needs-to-be-talked-about">horrifying</a> (all right, I’ll agree with that last one, albeit for different reasons than the journalists). </p>
<p>But the most “horrifying” thing to leftists today is Trump. <em>Vox</em> has a new “<a href="http://www.vox.com/results?cref=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.vox-cdn.com%2Fvox%2Fcse%2Fvox_cse.xml&amp;cof=FORID%3A9&amp;q=horrifying&amp;sa=">horrifying</a>” article about The Donald every week. And the thing that’s <a href="https://twitter.com/voxdotcom/status/785151601019199488">really scaring them </a>is the idea that Trump won’t concede if he loses. </p>
<p>Trump has been hammering what he calls, the Rigged System, promising to “Drain the Swamp.” If you’re a supporter, you’ll say it’s because it’s time to highlight Crooked Hillary’s corruption. If you’re not, you’ll say he’s making excuses because the polls show he’s losing. The latter crowd is mostly made up of people who are constantly telling us we need to deconstruct masculinity and show more empathy, but, like a feminist in an Internet argument they go straight after your nuts when it’s time to criticize. Thus, President Obama accuses Trump of whining and essentially being a wimp. </p>
<p>As even some neoconservatives are pointing out, Democrats have also been fond of <a href="http://freebeacon.com/POLITICS/TRUMPS-NOT-ONLY-ONE-THINKS-SYSTEM-RIGGED/">denouncing a supposed “rigged” government in the past</a>. Just like the phrase “<a href="http://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/lachlan-markay/2010/10/14/taking-back-america-wasnt-racist-until-liberals-stopped-saying-it">Take Back America</a>” went from standard political rhetoric to “racist extremism” once Republicans started using it, we are supposed to believe that when Trump says it’s a “Rigged System” it’s an existential threat to democracy itself. </p>
<p>Yet even when you get past the wrist flapping and hyperbole, Trump really is saying something different this time. In his recent speech in Florida condemning the media, Trump described journalists as <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/nyt-trump-poisoning-minds-of-electorate-with-his-conspiracy-theory-about-carlos-slims-bailout-of-nyt">enforcers of a plutocratic agenda</a>  and dismissed political correctness as simply a weapon of elite control. He’s called <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/oct/17/donald-trump-warns-voting-fraud-calls-gop-leaders-/">Republicans “naïve” if they don’t believe in voter fraud</a>. Throughout the campaign, but with increasing frequency in recent days, Trump has suggested this election is the last time actual Americans will have some say in how their country is run, or even if they get to have a country. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-arizona-immigration-speech-text-2016-8">Quoth</a> the <a href="http://www.counter-currents.com/2016/09/memeing-the-god-emperor/">God-Emperor</a>: "This election is our last chance to secure the border, stop illegal immigration, and reform our laws to make your life better. This is it. We won't get another opportunity — it will be too late."</p>
<p>As Trump has explicitly stated in the past, this is a reference to how Third World immigration ensures conservatives will never again be able to win another election. And it’s this tactical insight – that conservatism cannot win again, that to even imagine it is to indulge in fantasy– which has forced the radical rethinking process at the core of the Alt Right. </p>
<p>The core of this rethinking, even if Trump himself does not recognize it, is racial. It’s not just that non-whites vote differently. It’s that their presence imposes an entirely new culture, one entirely incompatible with the institutions and way of life European-Americans expect in a First World country. </p>
<p>Obviously, despite the Lügenpresse’s attempts at denialism, voter fraud is widespread in this country. As James O’Keefe’s recent videos have shown, besides openly inciting violence (which <a href="http://www.counter-currents.com/2014/11/who-is-responsible-for-ferguson/">journalists</a> then blame on Trump supporters) leftists are fairly <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/10/18/commit-voter-fraud-massive-scale-part-ii-project-veritas-investigation-clinton-network/">open</a> about their intention to get illegal aliens voting. The dead <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/sep/23/colorado-voter-fraud-revealed-slew-of-ballots-cast/">are voting in Colorado</a> and Virginia; there’s a <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2016/10/17/largest-voter-fraud-probe-underway-north-texas/">huge investigation</a> off fraudulent mail-in voting in Texas. And Jeff Bezos’s blog is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/10/21/donald-trumps-conspiracy-theories-about-voting-in-philadelphia-are-preposterous/?utm_term=.5da7a703a7ca">wow just wowing</a> about how immoral it is that anyone could believe there is voter fraud in such bastions of responsible government as Philadelphia, Chicago, and St. Louis.</p>
<p>Whatever their moral posturing, kosher conservatives and political consultants know Republicans lose if there is high minority turnout. Progressives are right when they accuse Republicans of effectively “disenfranchising” blacks and Hispanics with calls for voter ID laws. What they miss is that “true conservatives” really do have the <a href="http://www.radixjournal.com/journal/2015/8/18/protective-stupidity">protective stupidity</a> necessary which prevents them from recognizing the incompatibility of minimum standards for voting and racial equality. </p>
<p>Naturally, there’s nothing explicitly racist about linking voting (which is, after all, an exercise of force) to at least the same standard of responsibility demanded to buy liquor or rent a car. On paper, the case is obvious. But any kind of standard is going to have the practical impact of suppressing the massive and monolithic black vote Democrats need to stay in power. And as all politics is identity politics, requiring ID to vote becomes morally problematic in The Current Year. Conservatives may advocate some kind of minimum standard, but they will do so half-heartedly and apologetically. </p>
<p>In the same way, “true conservatives” briefly <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/david-harsanyis-civics-test-for-voting-is-aimed-at-trump-voters-but-minorities-would-be-hardest-hit">floated the idea of a civics test requirement in order to prevent Trump supporters from voting</a>, but shut up once it was clear it would <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/disparate-impact-and-voting-rights-for-the-ignorant">mostly affect non-whites</a>. Protective stupidity is thus united with masochistic moral cowardice. True conservatives feel free to attack Whites as a group, but will back down if leftists accuse them of being racist against non-whites. </p>
<p>The result is the worst political combination possible. Conservatives are dependent on European-Americans, but refuse to represent them and indeed, actively work against their interests when they can get away with it. They appeal to non-white voters rhetorically but don’t offer them anything in substance, instead vainly pretending if they can find a token black or light skinned Hispanic to prattle about upper-class tax cuts or opposing Russia that the hoods and barrios will start rallying to the banner of Paul Ryan’s “Better Way.” </p>
<p>No one is disputing conservative impotence any longer. “True conservative” principles matter to European-Americans and only European-Americans. After all, what future does “constitutional conservatism” have when the Constitution itself is <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-constitution_us_5808209fe4b0180a36e8d1b6">held to be offensive</a> because it was the product of a time when only white, property-owning males (i.e. people who had a stake in the future of the polity) had the vote?</p>
<p>Despite the hatred between the two camps, both “true conservatism” and White identity politics are driven by the same strategic imperative. </p>
<p>In a multicultural country with no common identity, political victory depends on  maximizing the White vote share and limiting minority votes. </p>
<p>The leftist counter to this strategy is also obvious. Import as many non-white voters as possible, with the less they have to contribute to the society, the better. Each non-white vote imported serves to disenfranchise existing European-Americans and with each hour Americans lose more and more of the country their ancestors created. </p>
<p>At the same time, as Trump pointed out, a media concentrated within just a few hands launches coordinated and overwhelming hate campaigns against any patriotic figure who resists a demographic transformation demanded by the wealthiest and most powerful. This makes status conscious Whites leery of championing any kind of collective racial interest. </p>
<p>The push for economic, social, and (in Europe today, America tomorrow) political punishments against dissenters ensures there is no overt resistance to this unprecedented transformation of every First World nation. And it is impossible not to notice the leading role of Jews, members of the most outrageously privileged group in the West, demanding the moral disarmament of Whites in the name of combatting “privilege.” </p>
<p>At no point in any nation did Whites vote to abolish themselves, and in many cases (as with Prop 187 in California) they explicitly voted against what is happening. Yet it continues regardless. Of course, the system is rigged. That’s precisely why mass immigration is taking place to begin with. </p>
<p>That’s why Univision chairman (and Israeli citizen) (((Haim Saban))) is <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article107565637.html">screaming</a> for Hillary to push for more immigration to guarantee future victories. That’s why the political career of a Richard Nixon or a Ronald Reagan could never get off the ground in the one party state of California. Even kosher cons admit the only reason Al Franken is in the Senate (and thus, the only reason <a href="http://www.occidentaldissent.com/2010/03/17/white-nationalism-the-only-realistic-solution/">Obamacare</a> passed) <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/york-when-1099-felons-vote-in-race-won-by-312-ballots/article/2504163">was because of voter fraud</a>. Europeans, worldwide, will be a hated, despised, powerless minority, lacking even the vocabulary to express a defense of their own identity or interests. “Conservative principles” and the Constitution will similarly face extinction. Out of sheer self-interest, conservatives would be suicidal to urge continued fidelity to a broken system which is destroying the very people who created and sustain the polity. </p>
<p>Yet this is precisely the role conservatives are hastening to play today. Useless child Paul Ryan condemns Trump and defends “<a href="http://time.com/4532520/paul-ryan-donald-trumps-rigged-election/">our democracy</a>.” Marco Rubio and Pat Toomey blithely tell us everyone must respect the outcome of the election because confidence is needed to “<a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/rubio-toomey-dispute-trump-rigged-elections-claims-debates-n668006">pull us all together</a>.” And <em><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/441132/donald-trump-rigged-election-charges-false">National Review</a></em> is doing its best to assure us about how reliable our election system and denouncing “propaganda outlets” like <em>Infowars</em> and <em>Breitbart</em>.</p>
<p>Such collaboration can no longer be excused. Everyone, even the “true conservatives,” know exactly how this movie is going to end. And if we want to discuss something truly horrific, we only have to glimpse at today’s headlines for a sneak preview. </p>
<p>Thousands of English girls systematically exploited, raped, and sexually abused by Muslim invaders, with the de facto cooperation of the local Labour government. Boer farmers in South Africa subjected to the most gruesome torture even as their “democratic” government <a href="http://www.amren.com/news/2012/12/whites-and-guns/">denies them the right to defend themselves</a>. The ancient capitals of Europe systematically transformed into Third World wastelands, with the violent threat of terrorism and the grinding reality of occupation ever present. </p>
<p>This is a horror beyond anything our ancestors could even conceive. And America is not so “exceptional” that we will somehow be magically spared. The horror that denies me sleep, that makes me sick with fear for my children’s future, that fuels the terrible anger behind each word here, is the thought that this filth will be allowed to endure. </p>
<p>If this is not a Rigged System, if this is not tyranny, then such a thing does not exist. European-Americans are a colonized population being deliberately ground into extinction. To speak of America as a “self-governing” nation is an obscenity. And what is at stake is beyond the victory or defeat of some abstract political philosophy. What is at stake is the bare possibility of survival for our people anywhere in the world. If we are to live, this System must die. <a href="http://www.radixjournal.com/journal/2016/8/23/the-coming-legitimacy-crisis">It has long since been bereft of legitimacy</a>. </p>
<p>In the end, as happened with Whites in South Africa, current demographic trends ensure that political victory, effective representation or even a guarantee of basic physical safety will soon become impossible. <a href="http://www.amren.com/features/2013/05/when-patriotism-meets-conservatism/">When such a pattern becomes irreversible</a>, those Whites who go along with defending the existing System, no matter how “respectable” or “conservative” their rationale, are something worse than fools. They are <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/yes-2016-is-the-flight-93-election-and-republicans-against-trump-are-the-hijackers">collaborators</a> and traitors. And nothing can more horrific than rule by people like that.</p><div class="">
