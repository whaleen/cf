<div class="pf-content"><p>James:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/black-targets-matter-blm-thinks-target-shooting-is-racist">Interesting post</a>.  There’s a whole history and sociology of target figures to be compiled by someone.Perhaps it already has been.</p>
<p>You sent me off to Google Images looking for the old NATO Figure 11 target I <a href="http://www.johnderbyshire.com/FamilyHistoryJD/Photographs/05_1959-1971/page.html#frimley">trained</a> on in the 1960s. Incredibly, it’s still in use, or at any rate <a href="https://shop.actiontarget.com/content/f-11-nato-style-figure-11-target.asp">for sale</a>.<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vdare-live/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/21145039/f-11_N-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right"></p><div id="57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4" class="vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539">    </div>
<p>The Figure 11 guy is not clearly of any particular race or ethnicity. This being an old NATO standard, I guess he’s meant to be Russian.That should please the Democrat-Neocon axis, anyway.</p>
<p>On the other hand, to judge from the shoulders-to-hips ratio it does seem to be a person of maleness. I guess that’s sexist; so perhaps Hillary and the other <a href="http://www.johnderbyshire.com/Opinions/RadioDerb/2012-10-13.html#04">horsegirls</a> will be <em>less</em> pleased than McCain, Graham, &amp; Co.</p>
