<div class="pf-content"><p>Radio Derb is on the air–go <a href="http://www.vdare.com/radios/radio-derb-milo-and-me-cpac-purges-spencer-alan-colmes-rip-etc">here </a>to listen, <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vdare-live/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/24234911/2017-02-24.mp3">here </a>to download the MP3. Sample:</p>
<p>Meanwhile in these United States, supporters of Mrs Clinton in last year’s election continue to struggle with their grief.</p>
<p>Some of them have taken consolation in an alternate-reality website, <a href="http://www.hillarybeattrump.org/">www.hillarybeattrump.org</a>. The premise of this website is that Mrs Clinton actually won last November. So by visiting the site you can imagine yourself in <a href="http://www.johnderbyshire.com/Reviews/Math/everett.html">an alternate universe</a> where the United States is in the safe, responsible hands of a real leader, one who might almost bear comparison with President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov of Turkmenistan.</p>
<p>Sample headlines from today’s edition:</p><div id="57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4" class="vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539">    </div>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Clinton signs executive order mandating gender-neutral bathrooms in public schools, NASA spacecraft, and video games</span></p>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Law enforcement declares March “racial introspection month”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Clinton boldly invites press to attend White House press conference</span></p>
<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Illegal immigrant defeats Ann Coulter at Jeopardy!</span></p></blockquote>
<p>You get the idea. This inspires me to wonder whether, after a couple more election cycles and corresponding improvements in Virtual Reality devices, we might be able to equip all the losing candidate’s voters with full-world simulations in which their candidate won.</p>
<p>They could then live out, virtually of course, the kinds of things posted at www.hillarybeattrump.org. There at last would be an end to political rancor and division. The loser demographic could sink peacefully into their virtual-reality dreams, while the winning party got on with running the country.</p>
