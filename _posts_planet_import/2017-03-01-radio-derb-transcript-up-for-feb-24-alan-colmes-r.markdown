<div class="pf-content"><p>The Radio Derb transcript is up, go <a href="http://www.vdare.com/radios/radio-derb-milo-and-me-cpac-purges-spencer-alan-colmes-rip-etc">here </a>to read or listen. Sample:</p>
<p style="page-break-before: always;"><b>Alan Colmes, RIP</b>. Liberal commentator and radio host Alan Colmes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/business/media/obituary-alan-colmes-fox-news.html?_r=0">died on Thursday</a>. He was 66 years old and afflicted with a particularly lethal type of lymphoma.</p>
<p>I was an occasional guest on Alan’s radio show, and knew him quite well. After an appearance in September 2015 I recorded some thoughts about it, and about Alan — who was then, so far as anyone knew, perfectly healthy — in <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/derbs-monthly-diary-revivified-alan-colmes-jigsaw-puzzles-and-black-dysfunction-its-worse-than-you-think">my VDARE.com monthly diary</a>.</p>
<p>I started out that diary entry by telling the reader what a lousy radio performer I am, mainly because I don’t think fast enough. I’m a writer, not a talker. Then I wrote the following, longish quote from September 2015, quote.</p>
<blockquote><p>So why do I do it? Well, there’s vanity, of course. I like having that Fox News limo pull up outside the house to take me to Manhattan. It impresses the neighbors.</p>
<p>Mostly, though, it’s that I like Alan. Sure, he’s a Lefty, but one of the better sort. You could see this in <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/the-cuckoo-in-the-nest-jared-taylors-open-letter-to-cuckservatives">his August 31st interview</a> with <a href="http://www.vdare.com/users/jared-taylor">Jared Taylor</a> — see both the closed-minded Lefty ideologue Alan and the fundamentally decent Alan.</p><div id="57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4" class="vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539">    </div>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/road-to-reunion-forgotten-pulitzer-prize-winner-on-reconstruction-failed-to-hate-the-south">Reconstruction</a> phase following the end of the <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/the-cold-civil-war-two-groups-of-whites-fighting-over-america-with-minorities-on-the-sidelines">Cold Civil War</a>, when <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/john-derbyshire-cecil-the-lion-and-the-goodwhite-badwhite-cold-civil-war">Goodwhites at last have the total power they crave</a> and we Badwhite advocates are being hustled off to the <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/john-derbyshire-considers-his-future-as-a-zek-in-cultural-marxist-america">labor camps</a>, Alan will be one of the small number of goodwhites saying, “Hey, wait a minute …” He’ll probably end up <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/time-to-rethink-immigration-ii-freeing-america-from-the-immigration-gulag">breaking rocks</a> in the Aleutian Islands with us badwhite <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/shall-we-be-zeks">zeks</a>.</p>
<p>To some degree, in fact, this has already happened. Alan’s show is a sort of Aleutian Island of talk radio. Fox does little to publicize it and I assume — just from the fact of its being on Fox — that none of the big Lefty networks wants it. The “Free for All” guests are <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/vdare-com-editor-peter-brimelow-on-the-alan-colmes-show-texas-secession-white-rights-jewish-emancipation">low-rank bloggers</a> and freelance writers. The callers are mostly lunatics. I’ve heard Alan himself say: “I can’t believe I do this for a living.”</p>
<p>As George Orwell saw so clearly, it’s not just heterodox ideas that the Left hates, it’s human decency: the decency, for example, that believes even heterodox ideas deserve a hearing.</p>
<p>I doubt that anyone much on the Left likes Alan Colmes.</p></blockquote>
<p>End longish quote. I can’t think of anything I want to add to or subtract from that; so I’ll just let it stand as my parting tribute to a good man — a <em>decent</em> lefty.</p>
