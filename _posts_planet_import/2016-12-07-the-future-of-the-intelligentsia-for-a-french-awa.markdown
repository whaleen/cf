<p><span style="color: #222222;">Charles Maurras (1868–1952) was one of the earliest and most inspiring anti-modernists in Europe but has been little read or recognised outside France. This edition presents the first English translation of two of Maurras’ most important essays, </span><span style="color: #222222;"><i>L’avenir de l’intelligence </i></span><span style="color: #222222;">(1904/1905) and </span><span style="color: #222222;"><i>Pour un réveil français</i></span><span style="color: #222222;"> (1943). His views on the significance of tradition, money and the intelligentsia in the modern state in the first of the two essays are perhaps even more significant to nationalist-minded readers today than they were at the time of its composition. In the second essay, Maurras’ analysis of the monarchical tradition of French politics is a reminder that true conservatism is impossible in a parliamentary system geared to international financial interests, while formerly monarchical nations are viable only to the extent to which they continue the politico-social systems of their founding princes.</span></p><div class="">
