<p>Matthew S. Battaglioli is a dedicated lover of the social sciences. He was educated through the Ludwig von Mises Institute in Auburn, Alabama, where he passed his exams on economics with honors status. He is a member of the Liberate RVA organization and has written academic material for the Ludwig von Mises Institute, Liberate RVA, and The Libertarian Alliance. Matthew is also the author of <a href="http://arktos.com/product/the-consequences-of-equality/"><em>The Consequences of Equality</em></a>.</p>
<p>We begin by discussing the recently inaugurated Donald Trump. Matt tells us that he generally distrusts politicians; as such, he’s pleasantly surprised to see Trump fulfilling his promises. We then discuss Matt’s book, <em>The Consequences of Equality</em>. We learn that his experiences in college – in particular, discussing social issues with liberals – led him to question the notion of equality. This leads to a discussion on the history of this oft-fetishized concept; in particular, we discuss how John Locke’s ideas concerning equality are misunderstood in the modern era. The first hour also covers the Alt-Right, Bolshevism, and ends on the topic of economics and banking.</p>
<p>In the members’ hour, we continue our discussion on economics. We talk about the US debt, and consider the possibility of an upcoming recession. Matt argues that an economy is a reflection of time preference, and that economics can make or break a civilization. We then ponder how we can free ourselves from this debt-based economic system. Switching gears, we discuss moral relativism and legality. This leads to a discussion on Islam, liberalism, and how the average Leftist cannot be persuaded by facts. The members’ hour also explores Islam, gender roles, and what is necessary to maintain real diversity.</p>
