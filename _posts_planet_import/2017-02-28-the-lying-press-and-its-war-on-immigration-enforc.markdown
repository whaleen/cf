Its latest effort, as coordinated as if <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/msms-journolist-scandal-call-them-racists">Journolist</a> was still around, is an attack on recent arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) <a href="https://www.ice.gov/ero">Enforcement and Removal Operations</a> (ERO). And it should be interpreted as nothing less than an attempt by the <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/refugee-ranting-further-proof-msm-is-the-opposition-party">Opposition Party</a> to President Trump to sabotage and subvert legitimate law enforcement operations.</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2015/12/01/121_2015_ice8201_c0-200-3500-2240_s885x516.jpg?26cd1b174bbfe8f124bf681734d6f68691aafedb" alt="http://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2015/12/01/121_2015_ice8201_c0-200-3500-2240_s885x516.jpg?26cd1b174bbfe8f124bf681734d6f68691aafedb">For the uninitiated, ICE is one of the enforcement components of the Department of Homeland Security, and ERO is a subcomponent of ICE, with <a href="https://www.ice.gov/hsi">Homeland Security Investigations</a> (HSI). I’ve referred to it pejoratively as <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/mark-steyn-and-federales-ice-svu">ICE SVU</a> given its obsession with sex related crimes rather than its core mission of immigration related crimes. ERO is responsible for identifying, arresting, managing the formal deportation process of, and<a href="http://www.salon.com/2016/05/09/the_governments_cold_blooded_anti_immigrant_scam_how_ice_is_outsourcing_detention_and_deportation_to_local_police/"> removing illegal aliens, </a>generally from the interior of the United States. ERO enforcement personnel consist of Deportation Officers (DO) and Immigration Enforcement Agents (IEA).</p>
<p>In recent days, ERO conducted a nationwide operation aimed at a small sub-group of illegal aliens. This group consisted of previously deported illegal aliens, aliens with criminal convictions with outstanding orders of deportation, and other illegals who have absconded from release while awaiting hearings before the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/eoir">Executive Office for Immigration Review</a> (EOIR), the immigration courts.</p>
<p>The operation was conducted nationwide by Fugitive Operations Teams and were, as described, routine. The only thing new about the operation was that ICE DOs and IEAs made what are called <a href="http://www.thenyic.org/ICEmemo">collateral arrests, e.g. they arrested other illegal aliens they encountered</a>. This marks a difference from policy under the Obama Regime’s Administrative Amnesty, when other illegals were released or ignored.</p>
<p>You can see that policy in action during this CNN video shot while documenting ICE agents in the field in 2016.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But you will probably notice something else. CNN makes no mention of the ERO officers wearing the “Police” identifier on their body armor. That common sense label, however, is now the source of the latest manufactured crisis for the <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/yes-virginia-there-is-a-cultural-marxism">Cultural Marxists</a> in the media and the latest weapon in their <a href="https://www.lifezette.com/polizette/california-declares-war-on-immigration-enforcement/">war on immigration enforcement.</a></p>
<blockquote><p>During a nationwide operation this month by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a team of ICE agents in Los Angeles approached the house of a man targeted for deportation.</p>
<p>“Good morning, police,” one agent announced in the pre-dawn darkness…</p>
<p>The exchange, captured on a video released publicly by ICE, seemed routine. But it has reignited long-simmering objections from immigrant rights attorneys and advocates, who say the scene illustrates unethical — <em>and in some cases, illegal</em> — ruses ICE agents have used for years, portraying themselves as officers from local police departments to ensnare people or fool them into revealing the whereabouts of family members.</p>
<p>The use of the tactic, critics said, is particularly egregious in heavily immigrant cities such as Los Angeles and San Francisco, where police and elected officials have tried for decades to distinguish their cops from federal immigration agents, in an effort to convince immigrants living illegally in their cities that they can interact with local police without fear of deportation. The practice of using ruses predates the Trump administration. But the president’s announcement of his intent to dramatically increase the number of people ICE apprehends for deportation has increased concerns by immigrant advocates that the tactic will grow even more prevalent.</p>
<p>“There is something fundamentally unfair about ICE exploiting local and state policies that are trying to improve public safety by promoting immigrants’ trust in law enforcement,” said Frances Miriam Kreimer, senior attorney at Dolores Street Community Services in San Francisco.</p>
<p>[<a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-immigration-deportation-ruses-20170219-story.html"><em>It’s Legal For An Immigration Agent To Pretend To Be A Police Officer Outside Someone’s Door. But Should It Be?</em></a>, by Joel Rubin, <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, February 21, 2017]</p></blockquote>
<p>Rubin, <a href="mailto:joel.rubin@latimes.com">contact him here</a>, repeats the lie from the Treason Bar that such tactics by ERO and other Federal agents, are somehow illegal, immoral, or unethical. It is not illegal for any Federal law enforcement officer to identify themselves as police officers, regardless of whether those officers or agents are enforcing Federal immigration law or any other law.</p><div id="57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4" class="vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539">    </div>
<p>In fact, most Federal law enforcement officers are trained specifically to identify themselves as “police” for a few simple reasons. First, “police” is understood in many languages as conveying the idea of law enforcement officers acting with legal authority, e.g. it is understood immediately despite variations in pronunciation, in French, German, and especially Spanish.</p>
<p>Second, the authority it conveys is clear and quick to say, unlike if you worked for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Enforcement and Removal Operations. Try getting someone to understand <em>that</em> early in the morning, or in an emergency, or while telling someone to stop or you will shoot. “Police, Stop!” is much easier to say and understand than “Deportation Officer, Stop!” The word “police” is used for both conveying authority and the safety of both those encountered by Federal agents and the agents themselves.</p>
<p>It is true that it can also be used as a ruse. But that is also legal. Of course, the Lying Press doesn’t like that it is legal, so there is a campaign being waged against it as a stalking horse for attacking immigration law enforcement generally.</p>
<p>And it is part of a deliberate pattern started by the leaders of the <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/are-attacks-on-trump-a-textbook-example-of-coordination">hive mind</a> at left-wing hate sites.</p>
<p>For example, from <em>ThinkProgress</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Garcia, 31, reportedly told other worshippers he felt “something was not right” about the texts, but received a phone call from an officer confirming the accident and saying they would come to the church and escort him to the police station. As Garcia exited the church, he was waved over to a nearby McDonald’s parking lot by people who appeared to be local police. Other congregants asked if they could go with him, but men wearing vests with “Police” scrawled across the chest told them to stay at the church.</p>
<p>But as the Garcia entered their unmarked cars, witnesses say they realized the men were not local police, but ICE agents: Garcia was being apprehended.</p>
<p>“The very last moment, you know, is when we realized what was happening,” Gutierrez told WBEZ. “I go, ‘No, no no… this is not police. This is ICE.’ But it was too late, because he was already inside the car.”</p>
<p><a href="https://thinkprogress.org/ice-agents-lure-undocumented-immigrant-out-of-a-church-using-fake-text-messages-4e2a980fb7a3#.sa7ipca9t"><em>ICE Agents Lure Undocumented Immigrant Out Of A Church Using Fake Text Messages</em></a>, by Esther Yu Hsi Lee, <em>ThinkProgress</em>, February 17, 2017</p></blockquote>
<p>And then, the <em>Los Angeles Daily News </em>promoted an attempt by Los Angeles city officials to get U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to stop immigration agents from identifying themselves as “police.”</p>
<blockquote><p>Mayor Eric Garcetti, City Attorney Mike Feuer and Council President Herb Wesson all signed the letter, which was sent to Director Susan Curda and cited a recent Los Angeles Times story that claimed Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have been identifying themselves as “police” when arresting or detaining individuals for immigration violations.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailynews.com/article/20170223/NEWS/170229772"><em>LA Officials To ICE: Stop Immigration Agents From Identifying As ‘Police</em></a>,’<em> Los Angeles Daily News</em>, February 23, 2017</p></blockquote>
<p>Note that <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/340148852/ICE-should-stop-pretending-to-be-police-say-L-A-officials">the Mayor, City Attorney, and Council President identify the wrong Department of Homeland Security (DHS) component</a> involved in the arrests, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Nor did the reporter catch the error until later. He or she was much too busy reporting the party line than actually investigating the story. No wonder the LADN doesn’t identify their reporters.</p>
<p>More disturbingly, the specialty press in the <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/should-the-cops-enforce-the-law">law enforcement field</a> has swallowed the Kool-Aid and republished without review Rubin’s <em>Los Angeles Times</em> story at <a href="http://www.officer.com/news/12308150/tactics-by-immigration-agents-under-fire">Officer.com</a>.</p>
<p>The Lying Press is nothing more than the <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/steven-bannon-calls-the-media-the-opposition-party-and-then-they-prove-it">Democrat Party in opposition</a>. It has betrayed, and more importantly, deceived the American people. They claim to present facts but instead lie in order to further the goal of <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/electing-a-new-people">electing</a> a new people and replacing the historic American nation.</p>
<p>The Lying Press should then be treated by Americans as an adjunct of the Democrat Party and the declared enemies of the nation. None other dare call it treason. VDARE.com does!</p>
