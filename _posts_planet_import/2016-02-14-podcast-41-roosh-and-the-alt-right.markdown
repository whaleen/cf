Andy and Colin welcome special guests, Matt Forney and Matt Parrott, to discuss the recent allegations of "rapey-ness" directed at manosphere blogger Roosh V. Among the issues discussed are Europe's migrant rape crisis, changing sexual relations between men and women caused by technology, the attempt by feminists to widen the definition of "rape" in order to pass more power to the state, and tensions within the Alt-Right.

Running order and show notes are available here:
