---
Andy and Colin take a step back from the "devil in the detail" to take a "meta-view" of conspiracy theories. These are increasingly common in an age when rulers act like reptiles and social trust is eroded by mass immigration and multiculturalism. Among the CTs touched upon are those emanating from the Charlie Hebdo shooting, 9-11, the Holocaust, the rise of sexual promiscuity, and the Sandy Hook massacre.
