<p><strong><a href="http://www.counter-currents.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HailSatan.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-69503" src="http://www.counter-currents.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/HailSatan-211x300.jpg" alt="" width="211" height="300"></a>You There to the Left of Me</strong></p>
<p>Your world is rotten, but even more than<br>
That, it’s hypocritical, it doesn’t<br>
Consider its rottenness as rotten<br>
Because it’s as willfully blind as it’s bent<br>
(And by bent I meant crooked, and I meant</p>
<p>Corrupted, too). I hate everyone of<br>
You, every so-called liberal thinker wont to<br>
Repeat popular mantras like “One love”<br>
(As if you wrote it yourself, as if you<br>
Were original, as if it was true <span id="more-69502"></span></p>
<p>And not just popular) “Anyone in<br>
Their right mind” (as if the rest of us were<br>
Always mad and wrong), “Fuck your Christian sin”<br>
(Where Christianity is a trigger<br>
Term used for showing others how bigger</p>
<p>You are than it. I’m not exactly a<br>
Christian and I find it insulting that<br>
You think the word Christian is a pat way<br>
To put an entire people down). “Fat<br>
Positive” (as if it means ‘Better at</p>
<p>Being authentically human than those<br>
Of you who are not obese’, as if it<br>
Means fat people are evolved…I suppose<br>
It also means they are content to sit<br>
And eat convenience food by the bucket</p>
<p>So they can become even better and<br>
Evolve more as time goes on, unlike we<br>
Who weigh far less and therefore understand<br>
Far less about ourselves and our body<br>
Images and social perceptions). Mostly</p>
<p>I hate the fact that I can’t even get<br>
To hate you without having to explain<br>
Why I hate you because you are dead set<br>
Against being willing to just listen<br>
Without a type of pop comprehension</p>
<p>Being used. You disgust me and exhaust<br>
Me. Still, your days are numbered seeing as<br>
Your type of person will always eat its<br>
Own right there along with everything else<br>
Because no one is right or virtuous</p>
<p>Except you and there’s no talking to you<br>
Because all of you are you, you’re the same<br>
One over and over, there’s no point to<br>
Your hate except outwards. Give rage a name<br>
For today. Tomorrow’s a whole new game.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p><strong>What You Lack</strong></p>
<p>You’ll never be like us. The black sun shines<br>
Within, not without. We are part of lines<br>
That connect to each other as far back<br>
As time can reach. Our holy sigils, black<br>
Rays that extend from worlds you will not find,<br>
Make us who we are. They are not designs<br>
That can be bought or sold. A redefined<br>
Heritage is no heritage, you’re not our kind<br>
You’ll never be<br>
We are not the same as you. Flesh combines<br>
With soul and becomes life. Spirit assigns<br>
Soul, each to proper each, there is no slack,<br>
No give, no “same as us”. . . for what you lack<br>
You’ll never be.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">*</p>
<p><strong>Three’s A Charm</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Stepped Over</strong></em></p>
<p>They asked me what I thought of (((them))); I said<br>
I never did. I hate circuses and bread.</p>
<p><em><strong>What They’d like the English to Think</strong></em></p>
<p>Empire’s crumbled?<br>
Mustn’t grumble.</p>
<p><em><strong>Why We Must Resist</strong></em></p>
<p>Because it’s easier to miss red pills<br>
When the soul is smashed and the heart is ill.</p>
