<p>A professor <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2016/12/26/drexel-white-genocide-prof-wont-apologize-says-violent-racists-smearing-him/">brags about his desire to genocide an entire race</a>. He is the victim. Those who notice what he’s done are evil because “White genocide” is somehow both a <a href="http://www.alternet.org/human-rights/debunking-latest-breitbart-promoted-right-wing-racist-paranoid-buzzword">myth</a> and a self-evident good.</p>
<p>Members of a group who commit wildly disproportionate violence against both their own and other peoples are occasionally shot by police while committing crimes. This is “<a href="http://www.breitbart.com/california/2016/10/10/black-lives-matter-accuses-police-of-genocide-at-uc-irvine/">genocide</a>” against this group. Those who deny it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgHEeLXiB18">have death wished upon them</a> by thousands of people. Those who make these threats are praised for doing so.</p>
<p>People whose presence in the country is illegal, go on to commit additional crimes. A newly elected president, widely called a “fascist,” says he will deport them. This <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/utah-backs-trump-75-want-criminal-aliens-deported">is called an attack on families</a>. </p>
<p>The President-elect takes a congratulatory phone call from an American ally under constant threat of attack and invasion by a nominally Communist and indisputably authoritarian state. This is condemned as a provocation. </p>
<p>The same President-elect praises a far less repressive leader for not imposing sanctions on the United States to the detriment of both countries. This is also condemned as a provocation. </p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/of-donuts-divas-and-celebrity-tantrum-itis-the-ariana-grande-incident">donut-licking</a> thot famous for posing in cat ears and grinding to autotune baselines about getting screwed till you can’t walk excites one of the thirsty male fans that sustain her lifestyle. This is taken for a violation of the decorum she evidently expects. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ariana-grande-sums-up-the-problem-with-slut-shaming-in-4-spot-on-tweets_us_586678b5e4b0d9a5945b00f9">She is now a feminist hero</a>.  </p>
<p>A homosexual teacher and his “husband” commit suicide after being <a href="http://christiannews.net/2016/12/29/police-say-gay-rights-advocate-husband-who-committed-suicide-molested-10-adolescent-boys/">exposed</a> for abusing underage boys for years. They claim <a href="http://people.com/crime/minnesota-teacher-sexually-abused-children/">they are the real victims</a> in a suicide note and <a href="http://www.twincities.com/2016/08/29/south-st-paul-teacher-husband-found-dead-in-washington-both-being-investigated-by-police/">other teachers hold a moment of silence for them</a>. The school which presided over the abuse issues a bland statement about how it strives to provide a “safe and secure learning environment,” and is offering “mental health counseling.”</p>
<p>Members of one group receive preferential treatment in applying for jobs and coveted slots in elite institutions. Individuals of mixed race, or even entirely of other races, <a href="http://www.radixjournal.com/journal/2015/6/20/based">try to become members of this group</a> to receive social and economic benefits. This group is still “oppressed.” Even denying that this group is oppressed renders one a “racist.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.radixjournal.com/blog/2014/5/11/privilege-by-another-name">Members of another group</a> have high rates of income and education relative to other groups. They systematically organize in defense of their group identity and are concentrated in culturally influential professions. The United States military defends their ethnostate, even though the alliance brings no benefit to America anyone can identity. This group is also “oppressed.” If you deny it, your career will be ended and you will be cast out of polite society.</p>
<p>Violence and shootings of predominantly African-American residents have increased in most major cities across the country, especially in cities affected by a movement proclaiming itself “Black Lives Matter.” Attacks on police officers have also increased, including ambushes against cops sitting in their cars. In response to the unrest, there is now a painting <a href="http://ijr.com/2016/12/766256-painting-of-cops-as-pigs-hung-proudly-in-u-s-capitol/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">portraying police officers as pigs hanging</a> in the U.S. Capitol’s office complex. Saying “All Lives Matter” is a deeply offensive statement. Saying “White Lives Matter” is economic suicide.</p>
<p>An activist group attempts to <a href="http://www.radixjournal.com/blog/2016/12/23/the-rotten-crowd">extort a woman</a> for financial gain. The government and the media join the campaign. This is called activism for “human rights.”</p>
<p>Voters in the United Kingdom overcome an unprecedented media campaign and say they want to withdraw from the European Union. A thrice-married woman from Guyana who moved to England at 10, whose latest husband is nicknamed “<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-01/brexit-isn-t-first-fight-for-gina-miller-and-mr-hedge-fund">Mr. Hedge Fund</a>,” files a lawsuit and stops it. She credits her “strength” to the breakup of her last marriage. Her ex-husband <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3909050/Brexit-legal-challenger-claims-walked-EU-hating-ex-husband-physically-abused-says-left-alcoholic-cheater.html">says</a> she simply married someone who had more money.  She is praised as the “woman of the century.” Perhaps she is.</p>
<p>A ‘model’ named Tess Holiday, who weighs 280 pounds, is too disgustingly obese to fit into a complimentary robe provided at hotels. She “<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4059354/One-size-fits-hardly-Size-22-model-Tess-Holliday-call-standard-size-hotel-robes-posing-mirror-selfie-one-barely-covers-body.html">calls out</a>” the hotels. She is very brave.</p>
<p>The United States government, currently $18.96 trillion in debt, <a href="https://www.paul.senate.gov/news/press/sen-rand-paul-uncovers-government-giving-business-assistance-to-deported-illegal-immigrants-from-el-salvador">provides grant money</a> to illegal immigrants who get deported to El Salvador. This is perhaps one of the less objectionable expenditures of the federal government, which <a href="http://freebeacon.com/issues/the-10-most-outrageous-stimulus-projects/">include</a>, at random, $152,000 to stimulate adoption by lesbians, $100,000 to produce “socially-conscious puppet shows,” and $4.6 million to <a href="http://freebeacon.com/issues/feds-spend-4-6-million-give-emotional-wellness-refugees/">increase</a> the “emotional wellness of refugees.” Meanwhile, Republicans <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-11-16/gop-conservatives-back-trump-s-wall-but-wary-of-costs">say</a> Trump’s border wall may not be constructed because it is too expensive. </p>
<p>While Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton had a foundation where foreign countries could donate money. Reports from even left wing media sites suggest it may have been used in <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/10/clinton-foundation-pay-to-play-debate/504803/">pay-for-play schemes</a>. This was fine, but the incoming president has his name on hotels, so he should be <a href="http://lawnewz.com/high-profile/experts-trumps-conflict-of-interest-with-his-d-c-hotel-raises-serious-impeachment-issues/">impeached</a>. </p>
<p>A video game for children features a hero saving a princess. This is called <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2451596/super-mario-run-is-so-sexist-that-its-unsuitable-for-children-feminists-claim/">unsuitable for children</a>. A lesbian relationship is inserted into another video game. This is a “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2016/12/23/the-wildly-popular-overwatch-says-a-main-character-is-gay-will-this-be-a-step-forward-for-video-games/?utm_term=.d4bf2a4d5b1f">step forward for video games</a>.”</p>
<p>For no ostensible gain and after no vote, Europe’s most powerful nation insists on abandoning border controls to admit an unlimited number of young, male, Muslim migrants. It is perhaps the most consequential decision in postwar history, but there is no mainstream party which disagrees with the policy. The overwhelming majority of migrants are both unemployed and unemployable. The cost is ruinous. Crime has increased and dozens of lives have been taken in terrorist attacks. In response, the government is censoring news, covering up reports of crime, arresting citizens for posting criticism, and allowing armed thugs to attack anyone who disagrees. This is called liberal democracy.</p>
<p>A Catholic priest sets up a <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/12/29/parish-priest-dresses-virgin-mary-burqa-nativity-scene/">nativity scene</a> where the Virgin Mary is placed in a burqa and the Star of Bethlehem is replaced with the homosexual flag.</p>
<p>A woman says <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4060440/Woman-reveals-love-ROBOT-wants-marry-it.html">she is in love with a robot</a> and wants to get married. </p>
<p>Children as young as four are having <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2016/09/child-4-worlds-youngest-ever-sex-change-patient/">sex change operations</a>. A nine year old transsexual is <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2016/12/19/trans-girl-9-makes-history-national-geographic-cover/95584058/">on the cover of <em>National Geographic</em></a>. A male YouTube “celebrity” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000004706196/covergirl-features-first-male.html">was</a> recently made the face of CoverGirl. They are all, we are told proudly, “making history.” </p>
<p>At the same time, at a university named after a man who used to be called the Father of Our Country, history majors <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/vdare-radio-on-sanctuary-campuses">are no longer required</a> to study U.S. history. Given the quality of education, this is probably a good thing.</p>
<p>And finally, the only White father on television who isn’t portrayed as weak, cowardly, degenerate, or perverted is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUsCKZO09M">Literal Nazi</a>.</p>
<p>This is “normal.”</p>
<p>In contrast to the above, we are told Donald Trump isn’t “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/19/opinion/donald-trump-this-is-not-normal.html">normal</a>.” Indeed, he and his supporters must not be “normalized” by portraying them as reasonable people with legitimate ideas or grievances. In fact, those who did portray Trump as a normal man, <a href="http://gothamist.com/2016/09/16/fallon_trump_heads_on_sticks.php">television hosts like Jimmy Fallon</a>, should “go to hell.” </p>
<p>Instead, the propaganda of pathology must be intensified. Trump won because of “fake news.” He won because Russia “hacked the election.” He won because the media didn’t do enough to shut down “racist” viewpoints. It’s not because free people agreed with him and made an informed choice. It was all a nefarious scheme of some kind, <a href="http://www.radixjournal.com/journal/2016/12/13/illegitimate">some aberration of the natural order</a>. After all, what could be more sick, unnatural and self-evidently evil than a leader who, at least rhetorically, believes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCPYCXMxrZU">it is his job to guard the interests of his own citizens?</a></p>
<p>Of course, civic nationalism, as objectionable as it is to those who determine our morality, is not what they truly fear. What is the most horrific, noxious, and insane thing imaginable is White people living by their own standards and on their own terms. </p>
<p>There’s no scenario where White people are reduced to a small enough minority or stripped of enough wealth and power <a href="http://www.counter-currents.com/2012/12/can-you-drop-out/">to be left alone</a>. If the entire White population was one village living in the middle of nowhere, there would be an international media campaign screaming about the evils of “segregation” and exclusion. </p>
<p>In fact, there already is. Consider the situation in <a href="https://www.amren.com/features/2013/05/when-patriotism-meets-conservatism/">South Africa</a>, where a small but hardy group of Afrikaners have, in full compliance with the law, created the settlement of Orania where they can live in peace. It is in undesirable land near a desert. The people pose no threat nor can anyone seriously argue there is “exploitation.” Yet every year, some journalist goes there to pathologize the residents and implicitly agitates for it to be abolished.</p>
<p>The latest is from Thomas Page of CNN, <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/609757324589277184/WAh4qBGx.jpg">who appears</a> and <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/609757324589277184/WAh4qBGx.jpg">thinks</a> exactly as you would expect. His article marvels that the settlement is allowed to exist and sneers at those who “intellectualize the argument for self-imposed segregation” as opposed to embracing the glories of the Rainbow Nation. Orania’s residents have “divisive” views on race, we are told. </p>
<p>Page also shills for a book from a Swedish woman, Kajsa Norman, who <a href="https://twitter.com/kajsanorman/status/669170127087271936">worries</a> about the “radicalism” of her kinsmen that question their dying nation’s immigration policies. Norman spent time in Orania and, having been let into the lives of its residents, now works to deconstruct and destroy them. Poor Afrikaners have it rough, but they lack “empathy.” People in Orania may not be the most racist people she knows, but they are “not role models.” Incredibly, Norman also dismisses Whites’ fears of violent crime because more Blacks are victims than Whites. Of course, that’s also because they tend to be surrounded by other Blacks, which is exactly what journalists are demanding of Whites.</p>
<p>This is what you would expect of course. <a href="http://www.counter-currents.com/2014/11/who-is-responsible-for-ferguson/">Journalism</a> is not a profession; it is a tactic. It is activism by different means, no different in intent than protesting, sabotage, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/protests-expected-as-white-nationalists-meet-in-dc-saturday-and-celebrate-trump-win/2016/11/18/2b495d02-adaa-11e6-977a-1030f822fc35_story.html?utm_term=.a3c9fbe50701">throwing shit at your political opponents</a>, or simply murdering your enemies. The usual goal of a journalist is to destroy his subject. Information is a weapon. Trying to “convince” a journalist is like trying to have an earnest exchange of views with the far-Left fanatic hysterically screaming he wants to kill you.  They’re the same people, with the same ends and driven by the same hateful beliefs. And they have truly skewed belief about what is normal and what is not.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amren.com/news/2014/10/inside-south-africas-whites-only-town-of-orania/">Orania</a>, in their view, is not “normal.” South Africa’s president <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fzRSE_p1Ys">singing</a> songs about killing Afrikaners at political rallies obviously is.</p>
<p>What is “normal?” Well, consider Steven Otter. He was a White man who rejected “self-imposed segregation” and lived in a Black township. He lectured his fellow Whites about the “misperception” of high crime. He <a href="https://twitter.com/Mbulelodwane/status/809714916022222848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">attended</a> rallies of the comically anti-White Julius Malema and his “Economic Freedom Fighters,” complete with a goofy red beret and indoor sunglasses. (Incidentally, abolishing the “racist enclave” of Orania is a <a href="http://citizen.co.za/news/news-national/1153187/eff-relations-with-orania-angers-mngxitama/">goal</a> of some in the EFF.) He also indulged in the kind of ethno-masochism pushed on Whites worldwide, <a href="http://www.occidentaldissent.com/2016/12/26/farewell-steven-otter/">berating</a> himself for thought-crime when he pondered “racist things.” Objectively, Otter was an unstable lunatic. By the standards of the society which gives us all the blessings listed above, he was “normal.”</p>
<p>And he died as you’d expect, <a href="http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/murdered-city-spokesperson-fought-to-the-death-20161216">murdered</a> by robbers who broke into his home, the fifth recent housebreaking in his neighborhood and the third on his street. No one has been arrested and probably no one ever will be. Does Otter deserve sympathy? Poor form to celebrate a man’s death, but Otter demanded that all White South Africans live like this, with no possibility of escape. Why shouldn’t he be forced to live, or die, with the consequences?</p>
<p>Norman smirks in the CNN article that Afrikaners who have “become the most successful in South Africa today have given up their Afrikaner identity and become South Africans first and foremost.” Otter was a South African and he died as one. And despite all the virtue signaling and temporary tributes, his death was essentially meaningless. None of the underlying premises of that Third World society will be challenged. In South Africa, the goal of the deracinated European is simply to make enough money to isolate yourself from social collapse – or just move to another country entirely, as many of the liberal Whites who agitated against apartheid have already done. </p>
<p>This is not meant as an insult to South Africa. Today, every Western country is a “Rainbow Nation.” An as an spokesman for the Orania Movement puts it to CNN, today there is an “existential attitude towards human identity that views it as a mere construct, to be reconstructed by anyone and everyone for and by him/herself.” I’d argue that to be “normal,” this is exactly what you need to believe. And once you build your society around this, the headlines above are only the beginning of what you will get.</p>
<p>The Orania spokesman said defiantly, “That is not the way we plan to live.” And neither can we. Living under siege is more noble, and more “normal,” than living the way we do now. And as some reviews of Norman’s book <a href="http://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/10/orania-the-desert-of-afrikaner-dreams/">note</a>, ultimately, the choice of whether to separate and survive or deracinate and die confronts not just the Boers but the Swedes and ultimately all Europeans. And this isn’t “normal.”</p>
<p>“Normal” is knowing who you are, living with dignity and purpose, and leaving a legacy which means something. Normal is pursuing the upward development of your own people, not tearing down everything decent and beautiful in pursuit of the twisted visions of egalitarianism. Normal is taking pride in your own nation. Normal is having a place to call home. We owe the perverted fanatics who seek to take this away from us no explanations, only defiance.</p>
<p>All the progressives freaking out about Trump and <a href="http://www.radixjournal.com/blog/2017/1/1/the-winter-of-our-discontent">the course of 2016</a> are right for the wrong reasons. This isn’t normal. Nothing about our culture is normal. Nothing about the state of our people is normal. But Trump’s election is one tiny step towards normality. And we should be confident in our eventual triumph and restoration. </p>
<p>After all, we are Europeans. <a href="http://www.radixjournal.com/journal/2016/11/21/long-live-the-emperor">Victory</a> is our birthright.</p><div class="">
