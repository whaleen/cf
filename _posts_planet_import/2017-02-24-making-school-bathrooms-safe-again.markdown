<p>It’s a small victory, but after years of constant losing, I’m not tired of winning even the small battles. <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_TRANSGENDER_BATHROOMS?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2017-02-22-19-10-17">On Feb. 22, Trump appointee and new Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos reversed an Obama Administration policy</a> that put public school locker rooms and bathrooms under the dominion of confused and/or perverse “transgender” individuals.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-secretary-education-betsy-devos-issues-statement-new-title-ix-guidance">As DeVos said Feb. 22</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>We have a responsibility to protect every student in America and ensure that they have the freedom to learn and thrive in a safe and trusted environment. This is not merely a federal mandate, but a moral obligation no individual, school, district or state can abdicate.</p></blockquote>
<p>So true! That’s why normal moms and dads around the country were aghast at the prospect of their daughters (and, I would add, sons) being subjected to the presence of members of the opposite sex in their most embarrassing and vulnerable moments.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, DeVos’s statement presupposed that “LGBTQ students” are a protected class. So again, this is a small victory. She even backed away from taking responsibility for the change by pointing to an August 2016 federal court decision that resulted in</p>
<blockquote><p>a nationwide injunction barring the Department from enforcing a portion of its application. Since that time, the Department has not enforced that part of the guidance, thus there is no immediate impact to students by rescinding this guidance.</p></blockquote>
<p>Like many Republicans, DeVos still hasn’t learned that no matter how much you try to make your thoughts, words, and actions inoffensive to Leftists, they’ll still accuse you of the worst possible crimes. Though the White House has denied it, <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/02/22/transgender-trump-sessions-override-devos/">some media outlets alleged that DeVos had actually supported the Obama bathroom policy</a> and that it was Attorney General Jeff Sessions who pushed to have it rolled back, forcing Trump to pick sides — and bring home a ‘W’ for the states’ rights team. Even if that scenario did happen, the Left is still murdering DeVos for backing down and falling in line with Trump’s final decision. You just can’t win with these people.</p><div class="">
