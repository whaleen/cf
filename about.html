    <h2>cf-compliance score</h2>
    A source's RSS feeds, Open Graph details, and other distributable constants are read by our system and produce a bill of health for each source. A source having properly supplied all essential data in their feeds will score high. Those whoe score low will see what can be done to improve their score.
