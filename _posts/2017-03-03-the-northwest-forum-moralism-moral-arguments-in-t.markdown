<p>This is the audio of Kevin MacDonald’s presentation at the Northwest Forum on February 25th, <span id="more-69704"></span>2017. I have edited out the voices of the questioners at the end (with one exception), but the gist of their questions can be inferred from Dr. MacDonald’s responses. Next week, we will publish the written text on which the talk was based. I want to thank Kevin MacDonald and our audio guy for the recording.</p>
