<p>Incredible as it may seem to all of us Johnny Carson fans, it has now been 25 years since Johnny Carson last hosted <em>The Tonight Show</em>. On May 22, 1992, Johnny hosted his 4,531st and final <em>Tonight Show</em>. As over 50 million viewers tuned in, there were no guests that night, and Johnny sat alone on a stool and conducted a retrospective hour and said a heartfelt final goodbye to his fans.</p>
<p>Since Johnny&#8217;s retirement, as all the other talk show hosts will freely admit, Johnny has been irreplaceable and remains the #1 most beloved talk show host in the history of television. Let&#8217;s take a look at a few little-known facts about Johnny Carson.</p>
<p>1. He started out in show business as a magician, calling himself &#8220;the great Carsoni.&#8221;</p>

<p>2. Early in his career, Johnny also worked as a ventriloquist. His dummy&#8217;s name was &#8220;Eddie.&#8221; <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" name="more"></a></p>
<p>3. While serving in the Navy, Johnny&#8217;s biggest moment was filling in for Rita Hayworth during a magic show given by Orson Welles and letting Welles saw him in half.</p>
<p>4. Johnny was 10 and 0 as an amateur boxer during his Navy service during World War II.</p>
<p>5. Johnny co-wrote the familiar <em>Tonight Show</em> theme with Paul Anka. Anka wrote the music, Johnny wrote the lyrics. Although the lyrics were never used during the show&#8217;s run, Johnny collected 50% of the residual payments. The song was known as &#8220;Johnny&#8217;s theme.&#8221;</p>
<p>6. When asked who he most wanted as a guest on <em>The Tonight Show</em>, Johnny replied &#8220;Cary Grant.&#8221; Grant never did show up as a guest.</p>
<p>7. He was an expert drummer. Johnny once appeared on <em>The New American Bandstand</em> and stood in for the drummer.</p>
<p>8. In 1966, Johnny single-handedly helped popularize the new board game Twister, when he played a round of the game with Eva Gabor on the show. Sales of &#8220;twister&#8221; soon skyrocketed.</p>
