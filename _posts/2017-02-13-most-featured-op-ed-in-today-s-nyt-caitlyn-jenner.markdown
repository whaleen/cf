&lt;p&gt;The funny thing is that, due to our pervasive mental atmosphere that makes noticing patterns disreputable, almost nobody has noticed how funny this phenomenon is: that there exists a rare form of mental illness that occasionally strikes highly masculine, higher IQ middle-aged men and convinces them that, despite all the evidence to the contrary (their children, their military or sporting accomplishments, their sci-fi obsessions, etc.) that they’ve always been a girl on the inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4&quot; class=&quot;vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539&quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… And the victims of this delusion are almost all right-of-center in their political / cultural views!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtually none of the prominent late-onset M to F transgenders are conventional liberals: e.g., golfing Republican&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=+Bruce+Jenner,+site:vdare,com&amp;amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;amp;ei=ZP-gWMueLYm4jwTKiZrwCQ&quot;&gt; Bruce Jenner,&lt;/a&gt; the Kiplingesque memorialist of the British Empire&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=+James+Morris+site:johnderbyshire,com&amp;amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;amp;ei=BQChWIysCqWPjwTV1o-gCQ&quot;&gt; James Morris&lt;/a&gt;, libertarian economist &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=Donald+McCloskey,++site:vdare.com&amp;amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;amp;ei=RQChWNP9L6rZjwT28rCABg&quot;&gt;Donald McCloskey, &lt;/a&gt;outer space entrepreneur &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vdare.com/posts/a-celebrity-who-probably-really-does-feel-like-the-opposite-sex-on-the-inside-wnbas-6-8-brittney-griner&quot;&gt;Martin Rothblatt&lt;/a&gt;, etc etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a conventional liberal seems to confer some degree of immunity to the ravages of this mental health syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But leftists these days are too dumbed down to get the joke that late onset transgenderism is a mental illness of rightists.&lt;/p&gt;
