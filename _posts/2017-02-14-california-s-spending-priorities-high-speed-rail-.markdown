<div class="pf-content"><p>The<i> Washington Times</i> has it right.[<em><a href="http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/feb/13/oroville-dam-flood-danger-recedes-state-criticized/">California spent on high-speed rail and illegal immigrants, but ignored Oroville Dam,</a> </em>By Valerie Richardson, February 13, 2017] While California spent millions on Governor Brown&#8217;s high-speed railway to nowhere, the state failed to spend on infrastructure such as dam repair. The Oroville dam is not the only problem. California has many of the nation&#8217;s dams in need of fixing.</p>
<p>California <a href="http://www.wsj.com/podcasts/trump-infrastructure-plan-faces-speed-limits/B6141D80-57A5-4FEE-BD36-C715E310FDF8.html">requested grants</a> from President Trump&#8217;s promised infrastructure funding.</p><!-- TAG START { player: "7518-804336-VDare - Outstream - Rev", owner: "ONE Video by AOL", for: "ONE Video by AOL" - BEINJS } --><div id="57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4" class="vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539">    <script type="text/javascript" src="//delivery.vidible.tv/jsonp/pid=57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4/56bcd17ce4b018167fea5539_bein.js"></script></div><!-- TAG END { date: 07/25/16 } -->
<p>Nevertheless, the state had money to hire former Attorney General Eric Holder to intercede on California&#8217;s behalf against the Federal Government for actions in the state&#8217;s interest. [<em><a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-california-legislature-eric-holder-donald-trump-20170104-story.html">California braces for a Trump presidency by tapping former U.S. Atty. Gen. Eric Holder for legal counsel,</a> </em>by Melanie Mason, LA Times, January 4, 2017] The contract does not spell out what that work might be. The contract will pay $25,000 per month for 40 hours of work.</p>
<p>Perhaps California might use Eric Holder&#8217;s services to plead for federal money to fix the state&#8217;s dams.</p>
