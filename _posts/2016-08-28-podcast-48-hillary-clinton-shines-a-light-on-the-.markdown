Colin and Andy discuss Hillary Clinton's recent speech attacking the Alt-Right and attempting to link us to Donald Trump. Have we really taken over the Republican Party, and are we part of a "vast right-wing conspiracy." involving the likes of David Duke, Nigel Farage, Alex Jones, and a large green frog â€” all controlled by Vladimir Putin? 

What does this say about the state of Hillary's campaign and her mental health? Is she really looking to start WWIII or is she merely trying to reach out to a few cuckservatives and neocons by using Cold War and McCarthyite rhetoric?<div class="">
