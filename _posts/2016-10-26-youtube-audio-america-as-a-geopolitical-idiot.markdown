A slightly edited audio version of Alternative Right Chief Editor Colin Liddell's latest vlog.  

In recent years the American Empire has been losing ground badly. Not only has Putin outmanoeuvred them in the Middle East, but now the Chinese have gained a major geopolitical victory by persuading the Philippines to break ranks, effectively opening a door in the archipelago of islands in Asia that served as a "sea wall" containing China's rising power. Colin Liddell, Chief Editor of Alternative Right, addresses this issue and comes to the conclusion that realpolitik and economic utility is a better foundation for geopolitical power than social justice posturing and pandering to the interests of an ethnic donor class.
