   A slightly edited audio version of Alternative Right Chief Editor Colin Liddell&#39;s latest vlog.  

In recent years the American Empire has been losing ground badly. Not only has Putin outmanoeuvred them in the Middle East, but now the Chinese have gained a major geopolitical victory by persuading the Philippines to break ranks, effectively opening a door in the archipelago of islands in Asia that served as a &quot;sea wall&quot; containing China&#39;s rising power. Colin Liddell, Chief Editor of Alternative Right, addresses this issue and comes to the conclusion that realpolitik and economic utility is a better foundation for geopolitical power than social justice posturing and pandering to the interests of an ethnic donor class.
