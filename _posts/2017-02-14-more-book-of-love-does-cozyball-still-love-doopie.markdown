<div class="pf-content"><p>Inspired by my 2004 &#8220;Book of Love&#8221; column, a reader has dug out <a href="http://nyp.nypost.com/classifieds/20170214/classifieds.pdf">this year&#8217;s version</a> from the <em>New York Post</em> online version (you have to go to the Classifieds).  He opines that there has been a falling-off in quality this past thirty years.</p>
<p>He may be right.  Of the 63 tributes I counted, only 49 are lovers (including spouses).  Nine of the others are parents or kids, two are pets, three are ambiguous.</p>
<p>Seems to me that&#8217;s more non-lovers than formerly.  There is of course nothing wrong with loving your parents, kids, or mongoose.  I rather favor such affections.  That&#8217;s not what St. Valentine&#8217;s Day is <em>for</em>, though.</p>
<p>A proper quantitative analysis would do a multi-year comparison, with due allowance for the decline of print media and the migration of this kind of thing to social media.  I&#8217;ll be glad to do that analysis if someone will pay me for it.  Hourly rates available on request from VDARE.com.</p><!-- TAG START { player: "7518-804336-VDare - Outstream - Rev", owner: "ONE Video by AOL", for: "ONE Video by AOL" - BEINJS } --><div id="57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4" class="vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539">    <script type="text/javascript" src="//delivery.vidible.tv/jsonp/pid=57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4/56bcd17ce4b018167fea5539_bein.js"></script></div><!-- TAG END { date: 07/25/16 } -->
<p>There&#8217;s definitely been a decline in the <em>noms d&#8217;amour</em>.  I&#8217;m glad Passion Kitten still loves Mountain Bear, but the rest are mostly just Mike and Elsa.</p>
<p>Are we headed down the same path the Japanese have taken?</p>
<blockquote><p>Almost 50 per cent of married couples in Japan haven&#8217;t had sex in more than one month, a new survey has revealed.</p>
<p>An investigation conducted by the country’s family planning association found that highest rate of sexless partnerships were among couples in their mid-to-late forties. [<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4223990/Nearly-half-Japanese-couples-haven-t-sex-month.html"><em>Japanese say sayonara to their sex lives: Half of the country&#8217;s married couples haven&#8217;t had sex in more than a month</em></a><em> </em>by Sadie Whitelocks; MailOnline, February 14th 2017.]</p></blockquote>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t mind <em>very</em> much so long as we got Japan&#8217;s immigration policy, too.</p>
