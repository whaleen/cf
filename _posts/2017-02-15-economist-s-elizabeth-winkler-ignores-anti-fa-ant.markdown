<div class="pf-content"><p>An <em>Economist</em> writer called Elizabeth Winkler (<a href="elizabethwinkler@economist.com">email</a> her) contacted me before Christmas about women in the Alt Right movement. I put her in touch with <a href="http://www.vdare.com/users/cecilia-davenport">Cecilia Davenport</a> and answered a few questions. The resulting smear recently surfaced: <em><a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2017/02/no-women-s-march">No women’s march|Women and the Alt-Right<strong>| </strong>Few women publicly identify themselves as followers of the fringe movement</a>, </em>February 1 2017.<em><br />
</em></p>
<p>I am quoted:</p>
<blockquote><p>Peter Brimelow, another Alt-Right leader who runs VDARE, an anti-immigration site, says this is because women are not drawn to radical politics. He points to the protesters that inevitably surround Alt-Right events: “These people are obscene and violent. The police will not stop them. Very few women, and not many men, want to subject themselves to that sort of risk.”</p><!-- TAG START { player: "7518-804336-VDare - Outstream - Rev", owner: "ONE Video by AOL", for: "ONE Video by AOL" - BEINJS } --><div id="57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4" class="vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539">    <script type="text/javascript" src="//delivery.vidible.tv/jsonp/pid=57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4/56bcd17ce4b018167fea5539_bein.js"></script></div><!-- TAG END { date: 07/25/16 } -->
<p>It is an odd kind of thinking that sees danger in democratic protests against fascism and white supremacism. But this is consistent with the Alt-Right’s sense of being victims in a liberal society. The notion that women shy away from dangerous politics does not hold up, of course: they have led some of America’s most radical movements, including labour reform, prohibition, and abolition—not to mention women’s suffrage.</p></blockquote>
<p>Subsequently, of course, &#8220;democratic protests&#8221; shut down a Milo Yiannopoulos meeting at Berkeley and a video of the pepper spraying of a female supporter of &#8220;white supremacist&#8221; Trump a.k.a. the President of the United States went viral.</p>
