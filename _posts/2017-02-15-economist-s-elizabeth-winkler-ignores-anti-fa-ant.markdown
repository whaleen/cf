   &lt;div class=&quot;pf-content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;em&gt;Economist&lt;/em&gt; writer called Elizabeth Winkler (&lt;a href=&quot;elizabethwinkler@economist.com&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; her) contacted me before Christmas about women in the Alt Right movement. I put her in touch with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vdare.com/users/cecilia-davenport&quot;&gt;Cecilia Davenport&lt;/a&gt; and answered a few questions. The resulting smear recently surfaced: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2017/02/no-women-s-march&quot;&gt;No women’s march|Women and the Alt-Right&lt;strong&gt;| &lt;/strong&gt;Few women publicly identify themselves as followers of the fringe movement&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;February 1 2017.&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am quoted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Brimelow, another Alt-Right leader who runs VDARE, an anti-immigration site, says this is because women are not drawn to radical politics. He points to the protesters that inevitably surround Alt-Right events: “These people are obscene and violent. The police will not stop them. Very few women, and not many men, want to subject themselves to that sort of risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4&quot; class=&quot;vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539&quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an odd kind of thinking that sees danger in democratic protests against fascism and white supremacism. But this is consistent with the Alt-Right’s sense of being victims in a liberal society. The notion that women shy away from dangerous politics does not hold up, of course: they have led some of America’s most radical movements, including labour reform, prohibition, and abolition—not to mention women’s suffrage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, of course, “democratic protests” shut down a Milo Yiannopoulos meeting at Berkeley and a video of the pepper spraying of a female supporter of “white supremacist” Trump a.k.a. the President of the United States went viral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rest my case.&lt;/p&gt;
