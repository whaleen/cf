<p>Jalen Mitchell reported to campus police on Jan. 26 that he found a note containing racist and homophobic language taped to the back door of his university-owned residence. After further investigation, campus police determined that the incident was a fabrication.</p>
<p>According to the police report, Mitchell, a senior vocal performance major, was questioned and asked to provide a handwriting sample which showed “similar characteristics.” When asked if he was the author of the note, he confessed to submitting multiple false reports to campus police.</p>
<p>“It was a way to try to get attention, to say ‘Someone notice me, I’m dying on the inside,’” Mitchell told <em>the Chimes</em>.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During the fall semester of 2015, Mitchell reported finding a similar note containing racial slurs and swastikas at his apartment. Police investigated the situation, but didn’t find any fingerprints or incriminating evidence to determine a suspect.</p>

<p>More recently, in the fall of 2016, Mitchell reported an assault on Astor Avenue, near the tennis courts. He told university police he was attacked on campus by a man with a knife during his walk home from visiting a friend. According to the safety bulletin, Mitchell received cuts and scratches on his neck, arms, leg and stomach, allegedly by a white male in his late 20s or early 30s with a full beard.</p>
<p>Mitchell wants those who are angry about the incidents being fabricated to know that he’s sorry, and he never thought it would go as far as it did.</p>
<p>“I didn’t mean to cause alarm, I didn’t mean to scare anyone,” Mitchell said. “I just wanted to be noticed … not for fame, just acknowledgement.”</p>
