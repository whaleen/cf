&lt;p&gt;“The sheriff here does not see a correlation…” What is unusual here is that local media spotlight the murderer’s illegal status. Clearly the political policeman thinks the right way to handle the situation is to tell his constituents to avert their eyes from the glaring fact that he failed to cooperate with feds, thus leading to the murder of an innocent American.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;EPHRATA, Wash. – Grant County Sheriff’s detectives called it one of the most savage murders they’ve ever investigated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jill Sundberg, the mother of four children,&lt;strong&gt; kidnapped by five men who were living here in the United States illegally.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sundberg’s body was found off the Old Vantage Highway in December. She and the suspects all lived at the Shady Tree trailer park near George.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The killer did little to cover his tracks, even leaving behind a message for detectives at the crime scene….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several of the men all told the same story: They were &lt;strong&gt;partying with the victim at the RV park, when Gustavo Tapia Rodriguez lost his temper with Sundberg, forced her into an SUV and kidnapped her.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4&quot; class=&quot;vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539&quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Five individuals, plus Jill, all in one vehicle drove her specifically down the Old Vantage Highway, and I’ll call it like I see it, they executed her,” said Jones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group of men then went and bought beer at a convenience store, but not before leaving behind something behind at the murder scene that would shock even seasoned detectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They they added one more salt to the wound, so to speak, and they put a note on her back and &lt;strong&gt;put a knife in her back,&lt;/strong&gt;” said Jones. “I&lt;strong&gt; won’t say what the note said,&lt;/strong&gt; but it sounds like it was a&lt;strong&gt; disrespectful thing and just absolutely gruesome.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it’s true the defendant was an illegal alien at the time of the murder, the sheriff &lt;strong&gt;doesn’t see a connection&lt;/strong&gt; between the killing and Tapia Rodriguez’s immigration status. However, if the defendant is convicted of this homicide, he won’t be deported again, he’ll remain here in the U.S. to serve what will be a very long prison sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
