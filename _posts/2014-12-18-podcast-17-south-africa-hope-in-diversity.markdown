Andy and Colin talk to Afrikaner writer and activist Attie Schutte about the difficult situation of Whites in the supposed "multi-cultural paradise" of South Africa. Among the topics discussed are endemic corruption in the ANC, the rise of Julius Malema's Economic Freedom Fighters, and efforts by Afrikaners to create true Apartheid (and diversity!) through all-White, Afrikaner-speaking communities like Orania and Kleinfontein.<div class="">
