   Andy and Colin talk to Afrikaner writer and activist Attie Schutte about the difficult situation of Whites in the supposed &quot;multi-cultural paradise&quot; of South Africa. Among the topics discussed are endemic corruption in the ANC, the rise of Julius Malema&#39;s Economic Freedom Fighters, and efforts by Afrikaners to create true Apartheid (and diversity!) through all-White, Afrikaner-speaking communities like Orania and Kleinfontein.           # => "Iâ€™ve been hurting to write this ever since we had the idea of creating a Planet for Cubox..."
