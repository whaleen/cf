<div class="pf-content"><p><a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/man-arrested-for-jcc-bomb-threats-appears-to-be-former-journalist-fired-for-fabrication/">Mediaite reports</a> that the suspect charged with a half-dozen bomb threats against putative Jewish targets is a disgraced left-wing journalist who was fired for fabricating stories. Oh, and he’s black, too.</p>
<p>In its early report, <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/nyregion/jewish-centers-bomb-threats-arrest.html">“St. Louis Man Charged With Making Bomb Threats Against Jewish Sites</a><a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/man-arrested-for-jcc-bomb-threats-appears-to-be-former-journalist-fired-for-fabrication/">,”</a></em> The <em>New York Times,</em> the paper of record,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/nyregion/jewish-centers-bomb-threats-arrest.html"> doesn’t tell us</a> much of anything.</p><div id="57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4" class="vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539">    </div>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JuanMThompson/status/835254106113593344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">Thompson tried</a> to blame his white girlfriend for the threats:</p>

<p>A fact Mediaite and the Times missed: <a href="https://archive.is/iBtl8">He’s a Muslim</a>.</p>
<p>Does anyone wonder what the Times’ headline would be if this man were a white, Christian Trump supporter?</p>
