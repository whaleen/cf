&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From: A West Texas Reader [&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:witan@vdare.com?subject=A%20West%20Texas%20Reader%20Expects%20The%209th%20%22Circus%22%20To%20Rule%20Against%20The%20Travel%20Ban%20Because%20The%20Legislation%20Is%20%22A%20Product%20Of%20A%20Racist%20Era%22&quot;&gt;Email him&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prediction: the 9th “Circus” Court (as Rush refers to it) will find the McCarran-Walter Act, also known as the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act–is a product of a racist era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 9th Circus will use “critical race theory” to paint a picture of the McCarran-Walter Act as an illegitimate thing of the “bad old days” of the pre-civil rights era. Another kind of Jim Crow. They will pull out any civil-rights-constitutional case that even slightly fits their pre-determined outcome, and morph it into something related to racial, religious, etc., yada, yada, discrimination. A synthesis of legalese mumbo-jumbo and sob stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will therefore find the McCarran-Walter Act unconstitutional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 4-4 deadlocked SCOTUS will wind up unable to overturn the 9th Circus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope I’m wrong. But we’ve seen this kind of legal snake-oil show before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4&quot; class=&quot;vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539&quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By shopping for Judge Robart to set up this confrontation, the Treason Lobby has “crossed the Rubicon” and knows that open-borders-mass-migration is the hill to die on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They know all other issues: foreign policy–taxes–health care- abortion–etc.–are mere side show. By electing a new people, they will control it all anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Treason Lobby is within a gnat’s eyelash of reaching its goals to implement its final solution of the American problem and to displace the Historic American Nation.&lt;/p&gt;
