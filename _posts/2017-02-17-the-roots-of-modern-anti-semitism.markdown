They too, of course, were gradually eliminated in the next purges. In a fascinating lecture at a Tel Aviv University convention this week, Dr. Halfin described the waves of soviet terror as a “carnival of mass murder,” “fantasy of purges”, and “essianism of evil.” Turns out that Jews too, when they become captivated by messianic ideology, can become great murderers, among the greatest known by modern history." </span></div></blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;">When 2% of the population represents nearly 40% of the Communist Party, they will be targeted. Theodor Herzl, one of the founders of Zionism, recognized this when he noticed that among national populations, those who do not fit the national profile are attacked whenever things go wrong. But even more, when a stereotype becomes <i>somewhat </i>true, the brutality that follows seems justified or at least forgivable to most people, despite being unrealistic.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Naturally the tragedy of the Jews comes into play here. The Jewish diaspora began before the Jewish people were exiled from Palestine. It lies in the mixed-race nature of the Jewish population, who were probably once European but became merged with Asiatics and Asiatic-African hybrids because of Israel’s place as the center of world commerce at the time.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kX5WXfZKdP8/WKbmVoUXxUI/AAAAAAAAVdE/goLL0TVkC8U5Li27d_e8rssB8f_ik-EVwCLcB/s1600/SpiderJew.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="253" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kX5WXfZKdP8/WKbmVoUXxUI/AAAAAAAAVdE/goLL0TVkC8U5Li27d_e8rssB8f_ik-EVwCLcB/s400/SpiderJew.png" width="400" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: large;"><i>More legs than body.</i></span></td></tr></tbody></table>The Jews are a bourgeois tragedy: successful in business, they accepted everyone, which led to them changing from a European population to a mixed one. This guaranteed them a home on none of the continents and, when their homeland in the middle east was dispossessed from them, a wandering group who could never point to an origin and say “there, alone, we belong.”</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Like the good businesspeople of the West today, the original Jews accepted diversity because it made good business sense. Thriving businesses do not turn down customers because of their national origin. But in doing so, the Jewish people invited in the hybridization that ensured they would never have a racial home or continental home except themselves.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">This fundamental alienation led to a fascination with anti-majority movements for many Jews, explaining their higher participation in Leftist movements. However, their lack of an identity in one of the four root races — Australid, Caucasian, Asian and African — then turned against them, as even the Communists recognized the power of nationalism.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">While this seems like a problem without solution, nationalism solves this problem. A new race was made: the Jewish people. It belongs to no one but itself, and it needs its own homeland, whether in Israel or Madagascar. It will never be European again, but it can be the best of what it is, and this begins with a divorce from the alienation that has led it into so many disasters.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In the meantime, these historical events prove how nonsensical anti-Semitism is. Our problem in the West is that we are following the path that the ancient Jews did because, as individuals, we are willing to “succeed” at the expense of civilization. We cannot blame others for our own moral failing, and indeed, doing so obscures what we must do, which is to change our ways.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><b>First published at <i><a href="http://www.amerika.org/">Amerika.org</a></i></b></div><br /><form action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post" style="text-align: justify;" target="_top"><div style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><input alt="PayPal - The safer, easier way to pay online!" border="0" name="submit" src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donateCC_LG.gif" type="image" />&nbsp;<img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/scr/pixel.gif" width="1" /></span></span></span></i></div></form></div></div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/SBfLZ/~4/K5UgKKn3tk4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/><div class="">
