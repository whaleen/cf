On this episode of This Alt-Right Life, I talk to Corey Savage. Corey is a columnist for Return of Kings and the author of Man's Fight for Existence: The Primalist Manifesto. In the first segment, Corey and I discuss his ideas on the nature of humanity, how what he calls "the System" threatens the existence of the human race, how technological progress and egalitarianism are altering human nature for the worse, and much more.

In the second segment, Corey and I discuss practical strategies for fighting the System. We discuss his ideological influences in writing Man's Fight for Existence, how men and women can take back control of their lives, how a worldwide revolt against the System is increasingly likely, and more.

This Alt-Right Life is presented by Chloe Luv and Davis Aurini. Intro song "The World is Changing" by Winglord, second segment intro song "Shadilay" by P.E.P.E.

Full disclosure: I served as the editor for Man's Fight for Existence, but aside from that and the fact that Corey and I are contributors to Return of Kings, we have no connections beyond that.
