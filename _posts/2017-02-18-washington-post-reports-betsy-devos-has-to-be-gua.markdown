<div class="pf-content"><p>The<em> Washington Post</em> reports that Trump&#8217;s secretary of education has to be guarded by the US Marshal&#8217;s Service. Normally, the only Cabinet member who needs this is one responsible for fighting the Mexican and Colombian drug cartels, but DeVos is fighting the American Teacher&#8217;s Trust, the NEA and all that that implies.</p>

<p>By Danielle Douglas-Gabriel and Emma Brown, Washington Post, February 17, 2017</p>
<p>The U.S. Marshals Service says it is providing security for Education Secretary Betsy DeVos after a handful of protesters prevented her from entering a D.C. middle school.</p>
<p>The move is unusual for the Education Department, which typically has a team of civil servants guarding the secretary, and for the marshals, law enforcement officers who are generally responsible for protecting federal judges, transporting prisoners, apprehending fugitives and protecting witnesses.</p>
<p>The last Cabinet member protected by marshals was a director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, said Lynzey Donahue, a spokeswoman for the Marshals Service. That office ceased to be a Cabinet-level position in 2009.</p>
<p>Donahue said that for security reasons, she could not provide any information about the number of marshals assigned to DeVos or say whether they are providing round-the-clock protection. It is unclear how long the arrangement will last.[<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/betsy-devos-is-now-being-guarded-by-us-marshals/2017/02/17/7dc341f4-f54b-11e6-8d72-263470bf0401_story.html?tid=pm_local_pop">More</a>]</p></blockquote>

<p>Why do they hate her so much? Has there been some kind of campaign of hate against her?

<blockquote><p>Cheered by journalists at a media roundtable in California late Tuesday, Marty Baron also said that despite some criticism, the Post is doing its job, not acting as the opposition.</p>
<p>“I just look at it as a new administration that we should be covering as aggressively, as energetically as possible. <b>If Hillary Clinton were in the White House, we would be doing the very same thing,</b>” he said at the Code Media conference.[Via <a href="http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2017/02/washington-post-we-arent-biased.php">Powerline</a>, emphasis theirs]</p></blockquote>
<p>Hillary Clinton&#8217;s possible nominees for Secretary of Education included a &#8220;black person to be named later&#8221; according to the <em><a href="http://www.dailywire.com/news/12289/hillarys-list-cabinet-picks-revealed-including-hank-berrien">Daily Wire.  </a></em>Tell me the <em>Washington Post </em>would have treated <em>that</em> person like they treated DeVos.</p>
