<p>Most Swedes have great goodwill and tolerance towards immigrants, and wish that immigration could have done better. Sweden’s experiments with large-scale immigration from the third world to a welfare state has been unique in its scope but have in many respects failed. Sweden’s social problems today are increasingly concentrated in the part of the population that has an immigrant background. Foreign-born people account for about 17 percent of the population, and second-generation immigrants, for additional five percent. Foreign-born people make up, despite this, <strong>53 percent</strong> of them with <strong>long prison terms</strong>, <strong>54 percent</strong> of the <strong>unemployed</strong> and the group receives <strong>60 per cent of the paid social benefits</strong>. <strong>71 percent</strong> of the <strong>country’s child poverty</strong> is among households with a foreign background, while <strong>76 percent</strong> of the members of <strong>criminal gangs </strong>have an immigrant background.</p><!-- TAG START { player: "7518-804336-VDare - Outstream - Rev", owner: "ONE Video by AOL", for: "ONE Video by AOL" - BEINJS } --><div id="57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4" class="vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539">    <script type="text/javascript" src="//delivery.vidible.tv/jsonp/pid=57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4/56bcd17ce4b018167fea5539_bein.js"></script></div><!-- TAG END { date: 07/25/16 } -->
<p>… Since the early 1990s, those with an immigrant background accounted for half of the increase in the proportion of low-income people, more than half of the reduction of powers among pupils leaving primary school, about two-thirds of the increase in social assistance and more than one hundred percent of the increase in unemployment – which dropped from Swedish born. Problems such as <strong>throwing stones at police and rescue personnel</strong> and <strong>arson</strong> are also highly concentrated in immigrant areas. It is important to develop concrete actions that give all immigrants Sweden has received a place in Swedish society. This in turn requires a sincere and evidence-driven analysis of how Sweden got here …</p>
