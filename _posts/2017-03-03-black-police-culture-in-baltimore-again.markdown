<div class="pf-content"><p>Gun Rights blogger Clayton Cramer <a href="http://claytonecramer.blogspot.com/2017/03/why-progressives-like-restrictive-gun.html">points to</a> this story about what an “elite gun task force” on the Baltimore PD was doing instead of arresting gang members with guns. They were doing “mob-style shakedowns”–extortion backed by a their own guns and badges.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://nypost.com/2017/03/02/cops-accused-of-mob-style-shakedowns-in-stunning-indictment/"><em>Cops accused of mob-style shakedowns in stunning indictment</em></a></p>
<p>By Joshua Rhett Miller</p>
<p>March 2, 2017 |</p>
<p>Seven cops in Baltimore assigned to an elite gun task force acted like “1930s-style gangsters,” allegedly shaking down citizens they falsely detained, filed fake police reports and made bogus overtime claims, according to federal prosecutors and top police brass.</p>
<p>US Attorney for Maryland Rod Rosenstein told reporters during a press conference Wednesday that the accused cops participated in a “pernicious conspiracy scheme” that “tarnishes the reputation of all police officers.”</p>
<p>The indictment now puts scores of active cases and investigations into question in Baltimore, where the alleged criminal activity happened throughout last year — when the city’s police department was<em> under investigation by the Justice Department for civil rights violations.</em>[<a href="http://nypost.com/2017/03/02/cops-accused-of-mob-style-shakedowns-in-stunning-indictment/">More</a>]</p></blockquote>
<p>These  <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-ci-baltimore-police-who-are-they-20170301-story.html">cops </a>are almost all black–5 out of 7.</p>
<p>The black-ruled city of Baltimore was under investigation (by the Holder-Obama Justice Department) because of the accidental death of Freddie Gray, a black drug dealer whose neck was broken during his ride to the police station.</p>

<p>At the time, extremely <em>faux</em> conservative <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conor_Friedersdorf&amp;oldid=659719587">Conor Friedersdorf</a>, [<a href="mailto:conor.friedersdorf@gmail.com">Email him</a>] did a piece for the <em>Atlantic</em> titled  <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/04/the-brutality-of-police-culture-in-baltimore/391158/"><em>The Brutality of Police Culture in Baltimore</em> |<em> Years of abuses are every bit as egregious as what the Department of Justice documented in Ferguson, Missouri, and as deserving of a national response</em></a> [<em>The Atlantic,</em> April 22, 2015].</p>
<p>What the Holder-Obama Justice Department  documented about Ferguson was that blacks commit more crime than whites. What Friedersdorf was documenting about the Baltimore PD was that they have <em>a lot of black police officers.</em></p>
<p>You couldn’t see that Friedersdorf’s story, but if you clicked through the links,  you could see that almost all the corrupt and violent cops were black and/or Hispanic. See <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/the-fulford-file-contrary-to-conor-friedersdorf-baltimore-doesnt-have-a-police-problem-it-has-a-black-police-problem"><em> Contrary To Conor Friedersdorf, Baltimore Doesn’t Have A Police Problem—It Has A BLACK Police Problem </em></a>for the details.</p>
<p>If the Sessions/Trump Justice Department were investigating Baltimore PD with the same frankly racialist slant as favored by Holder/Obama (which they won’t and shouldn’t–but will  be accused of anyway) the first thing they’d ask is “Why does Baltimore have so many black cops?”</p>
<p>A lot of minority police corruption <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/it-was-about-gangsters-who-became-cops">stems </a>from <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/ann-coulter-would-it-kill-you-to-hire-more-black-cops-yes">lower hiring standards</a> for minorities.</p>
