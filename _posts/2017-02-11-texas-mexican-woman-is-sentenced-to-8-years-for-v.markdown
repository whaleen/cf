&lt;p&gt;Rosa Maria Ortega’s mug should be made into a poster warning about voter fraud and plastered near every polling place in America. There’s nothing like hard time in the big house to show a government’s seriousness about a crime — and voter fraud needs to be prioritized, particularly when the perp is a moocher illegal alien. Mexicans do not have America’s best interests at heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #993300;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ortega’s crime rated a front-page spot on the New York Times’ Saturday edition.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details about the case show the Mexican has been comfortable as a liar: Ortega checked a box on her driver’s license form showing she was not a US citizen, but she indicated on a voter application that she was an American citizen and eligible to vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweet that she got a nice long sentence. A few more cases like that and word will get out that there is a new sheriff in Washington DC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Mexican citizen living in Texas was sentenced this week to eight years in prison for voting illegally in elections in 2012 and 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosa Maria Ortega, 37, was found guilty Wednesday on two counts of illegal voting after she falsely claimed to be a United States citizen and voted at least five times between 2012 and 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A jury sentenced her Thursday to eight years in prison and a $5,000 fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dallasnews.com/news/tarrant-county/2017/02/08/grand-prairie-woman-found-guilty-illegal-voting&quot;&gt;The Dallas News&lt;/a&gt; reported Ortega voted in the November 2012 election and May 2014 GOP primary runoff in Dallas County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4&quot; class=&quot;vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539&quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fox4news.com/news/235008409-story&quot;&gt;Fox 4 News&lt;/a&gt;, Ortega’s identity came into question after she tried to register to vote twice in Tarrant County. Both applications were denied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had voted in five elections in Dallas before her registration was canceled in April 2015.Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton – for whom Ortega voted in 2014 – assisted in the prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This case shows how serious Texas is about keeping its elections secure, and the outcome sends a message that violators of the state’s election law will be prosecuted to the fullest,” he said.&lt;span id=&quot;more-14729&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/10/us/illegal-voting-gets-texas-woman-8-years-in-prison-and-certain-deportation.html&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, Ortega was born in Monterrey, Mexico and brought to the U.S. by her mother as an infant. More than a decade later, her mother was deported and Ortega became a permanent resident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her defense, Ortega testified that she didn’t understand the differences between the rights granted to citizens and the rights granted to legal residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My mom just used us to get stamps. She never gave us love or guidance. She got deported,” she said, according to Fox 4. “All my life since I worked, I always on my knowledge thought I was a U.S. citizen because I never knew the difference of U.S. citizen and U.S. resident. And the point is if I knew, everything would’ve been the correct way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dallas News reported that prosecutors showed that Ortega has checked a box on her driver’s license form indicating she was not a citizen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the Dallas County election administrator said Ortega had filled out a voter application and checked that she was a citizen in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voter fraud became a hot topic after President Trump made an unsubstantiated claim that he would have won the popular vote if millions had not voted illegally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the long prison sentence, Ortega is likely to be deported, her lawyer Clark Birdsall said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She’ll do eight years in a Texas prison,” he told the Times. “And then she’ll be deported, and wake up blinking and scratching in a country she doesn’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
