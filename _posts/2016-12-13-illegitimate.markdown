<p>Donald Trump is President-elect, but the Crisis of Legitimacy <a href="http://www.radixjournal.com/journal/2016/8/23/the-coming-legitimacy-crisis">has arrived anyway</a>. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiNjanNtuzQAhUKQyYKHSHbD-YQqUMIHjAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fworld%2Fnational-security%2Fobama-orders-review-of-russian-hacking-during-presidential-campaign%2F2016%2F12%2F09%2F31d6b300-be2a-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html&amp;usg=AFQjCNHehx2_KPn4ag84X-W7ai_wE2LR9w&amp;sig2=Uo91EVKg3jO1qwRk0vIilQ&amp;bvm=bv.141320020,d.eWE"><em>The Washington Post</em></a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiNjanNtuzQAhUKQyYKHSHbD-YQqUMIIjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2016%2F12%2F09%2Fus%2Fobama-russia-election-hack.html&amp;usg=AFQjCNHm621VqjOW4G-5IYgbuUXyDLh2-w&amp;sig2=NQtFL1dYC8MZ1nqiiHOjyA&amp;bvm=bv.141320020,d.eWE"><em>The New York Times</em></a> are screeching that “the Russians” delivered Trump the presidency. One out of three Clinton voters <a href="http://theweek.com/speedreads/661791/1-3-clinton-voters-say-trumps-win-illegitimate">think</a> Trump’s win is fraudulent. The Fourth Estate is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/30/faithless-electors-electoral-college-donald-trump">cheerleading</a> an attempt by so-called “Hamilton electors” to launch a kind of coup to deny Trump the presidency. President Obama is even urging American soldiers to <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/12/07/obama-urges-soldiers-to-question-trumps-authority-criticize-our-president/">protest</a> their new Commander-in-Chief once he takes power, though Trump<a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/maybe-cia-washington-post-brainstorming-about-a-coup-needs-a-rethink-about-just-whom-they-can-trust-to-carry-it-out"> doesn’t seem to have anything to worry about</a> when it comes to his popularity among the officer corps.</p>
<p>In Year One of the Aeon of Kek, all that is hidden will be revealed. So we know none of this kvetching about “protecting democracy” or respecting the rule of law can be taken seriously. For weeks before that fateful night in November, Trump was besieged by demands to respect the result of the election, no matter what happened. Clinton used the Left’s favorite scare term, <a href="http://www.radixjournal.com/journal/2016/10/26/the-rigged-system">“horrifying,”</a> to describe Trump’s supposed reluctance to do so. </p>
<p>Now, that venerable constitutional order the progressives were defending only weeks ago is <a href="http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/7/12315574/electoral-college-explained-presidential-elections-2016">“the absolute worst,”</a> though their narrative is further confused by wishful thinking about “<a href="http://www.salon.com/2016/12/10/donald-trump-isnt-yet-president-and-the-hamilton-electors-have-one-shot-to-make-sure-he-never-is/">Hamilton electors</a>” defying Trump in <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rogue-gop-elector-join-opposing-trump/story?id=44070185">supposed adherence</a> to the Founding Father’s vision. Actually, if Alexander Hamilton did return, he’d probably be wondering why women, slaves and non-property owners are allowed to vote, <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/immigration-and-our-founding-fathers-values">why so many foreigners are being admitted</a>, and <a href="http://prospect.org/article/we-need-alexander-hamilton">how anyone could disagree with Trump’s America First trade policies</a>.</p>
<p>Any appeal by the American Left to the traditions of the Republic, to America’s patriotic heritage, or to national sovereignty can be dismissed out of hand. For decades, we’ve heard the Constitution is racist, the Founding Fathers were genocidal slavers, and that America doesn’t show sufficient deference to foreigners, <a href="http://dissidentvoice.org/2016/08/let-foreigners-vote-in-the-us-election/">who should be allowed to vote</a> and who should replace this country’s White majority. Such creatures are in no position to speak of what is or is not American.</p>
<p>One of the many glorious ironies of The Current Year is that Leftists lost because they gaslit themselves. So committed are these supposed egalitarians to snark, they interpreted any evidence Donald Trump could win the election the same way as they would a study on racial differences on IQ. They simply blocked it out of their minds, pretending it didn’t exist.</p>
<p>Thus, there wasn’t that sense of urgency which could have driven progressives to the polls to frustrate Trump. In Austria, where the anti-White forces had a real fear of defeat, <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/austria-rejects-far-right-party-norbert-hofer-presidential-election/">they were able to stop</a> a nationalist victory and so make the head of state a man who thinks his own country is <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/05/23/whoever-loves-austria-sht-president-elect-beat-nationalist-hofer-used-anti-patriotic-slogans/">shit</a>. </p>
<p>Here, progressives simply assumed Clinton would win because it was preordained. As (((<a href="http://www.radixjournal.com/journal/2014/11/6/why-lena-dunham-triggers-the-american-right">Lena Dunham</a>))) aptly summarized it, the presidency was “her job.” It was “her turn.” We were “ready for Hillary.” <a href="http://www.radixjournal.com/journal/2015/4/22/the-president-america-deserves">It was time</a>.</p>
<p>Trump’s victory was thus an inversion of a sacred moral order, or what passes for such among deracinated “global citizens.” When your entire self-image is built about status and signaling and the guy you’ve been mocking as “Cheeto Jesus” and “F—kface Von Clownstick” just kicked your ass in the most remarkable political victory in American history, what do you do? The answer is what we are seeing now, where any excuse and any line of attack is being used against Trump, even ones which contradict each other. </p>
<p>Trump has <a href="http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/11/13587532/donald-trump-no-experience">no military experience</a>, but he’s also creating a “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/opinion/donald-trumps-military-government.html?_r=0">military government</a>.”</p>
<p>Trump is part of a <a href="http://www.salon.com/2016/12/07/trump-turns-his-back-on-reagan-our-new-president-represents-a-confused-backlash-against-capitalism/">backlash against global capitalism, and a traitor to the free market legacy of Reagan</a>, but he’s also a tool of international finance and corporate donors. </p>
<p>Trump will never build The Wall and will betray his supporters on immigration, but he will also unleash a reign of terror on immigrants fearful they will be deported. </p>
<p>And so on. </p>
<p>He’s an extreme nationalist and a tool of foreign powers. He’s a militarist and a fascist, but also someone not willing to use force abroad. He hates workers, but he’s also threatening companies into remaining in the country. 
The arguments don’t matter. They are so incoherent they are not even worth listening to. All that can be understood through the chaos is the incoherent scream of hatred from the Lying Press and the <a href="http://www.radixjournal.com/journal/2015/3/15/unlimited-government-and-the-parasite-class">Parasite Class</a> it speaks for; a cry of loathing and fury against European-Americans, who finally made themselves heard. </p>
<p>Andrew O’Heir mourns Trump as America’s “<a href="http://www.salon.com/2016/12/10/americas-first-white-president/">First White President</a>,” or more accurately, the first president whose racial identity took on primary importance after America had been deconstructed as a White nation. </p>
<p>He sneers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So now they have Donald Trump, the avatar of white grievance and white resentment. He is the 44th white president, but the First White President to stand for whiteness as a special category, a downtrodden identity group of Dockers and Callaway golf caps and NCAA warmup jackets worn a full size too snug. Unsurprisingly, Trump seems likely to betray that demographic and hand over the keys of government to rapacious zillionaires and right-wing ideologues, like other white-centric Republican presidents before him.</p>
<p>We will all suffer the consequences of that. And the sad, secret meaning behind our First White President and the dawn of white identity politics is that there is no way back to the days of white certainty and white innocence. There will always have been a President Barack Obama; that Kenyan birth certificate never panned out and he will never be erased from the history books. It seems increasingly likely that Hillary Clinton will be viewed in retrospect as the true winner of a fluke election that exposed how dysfunctional our system has become. She isn’t running a child-sex ring out of a pizza parlor, and won’t be locked up or executed by Trump or anyone else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A fluke election? Trump’s victory was far more certain and secure than that of, say, George W. Bush, who won in 2000 because of one state and a Supreme Court decision determined by one vote. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/31/politics/bush-gore-2000-election-results-studies/">Some studies</a> suggest if recounts continued, and had been conducted in a certain way, Gore would have won. </p>
<p>Before that, there was Bill Clinton, who won in 1992 with only 43% of the popular vote in an election which featured the independent candidacy of Ross Perot. Jill Stein could scam another $6 million out of her donors and have as many recounts as she wants – it wouldn’t change the results. </p>
<p>And if Trump really is going to betray the White working class, and not pursue the policies he ran on, why is O’Heir upset? A plutocratic, anti-White agenda is exactly what we would have gotten under Hillary Clinton. </p>
<p>O’Heir continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of all the lies Donald Trump told to get elected, perhaps the biggest and worst was something he never quite said aloud but became the primary text of his campaign: White male hegemony could be restored, and all racial and sexual doubt and anxiety erased, because on some deep level that was the natural order of things. Isn’t that a correct translation of “Make America Great Again”? But electing our First White President is a dead giveaway that none of that is possible. If the republic survives this particular white president, we may have others in the future. But we will never again have an <em>automatic</em> white president, an invisible white president or a white president that nobody notices is white.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is ‘fact-checking’ at a new level, as Trump is now being accused of lying for something he never actually said. This reading seems more like projection on O’Heir’s part, rather than anything coming from Trump, his campaign, or even the Alt Right. It’s the Left which sees “the natural order of things” as multiracialism, hypocritical egalitarianism, and an explicit anti-white policy agenda. And a vast infrastructure is required to subsidize, browbeat, persecute, and incite all the necessary elements to keep this artificial system in place. The only thing “white male hegemony,” aka normal White society, would need to be restored is the boot taken off it’s neck for a split second. </p>
<p>O’Heir has a point when he identifies Trump as a “white” president in an age when this is no longer automatic. Identity politics has, <a href="http://www.amren.com/news/2014/11/politics-and-white-consciousness/">as I predicted</a>, been forced on European-Americans. O’Heir simply believes Whites shouldn’t be allowed to practice it, and should succumb meekly to extinction. </p>
<p>But O’Heir gives the game away when he suggests White identity was, in the past, the default mode for American identity. If this is true, why shouldn’t European-Americans have the exclusive right to the entire American heritage? Why should explicitly anti-White writers and activists have any claim to the flag or to the Republic? To Make America Great Again isn’t some revolutionary step; it is, by the Left’s own logic, simply to Make America America Again. </p>
<p>The excitable cries for coups, for Obama to refuse to step down, for war with Russia or for protests in the streets are a reflection that the Left’s project to remake the country demographically has instead deconstructed it entirely. The American state isn’t a loci of identity, but simply a weapon; an arsenal to be warred over by differing tribes who happen to reside in <a href="http://www.radixjournal.com/journal/2015/5/25/memorial-day-in-the-hollow-empire">the Hollow Empire</a>. Trump, as a civic nationalist and <a href="http://www.counter-currents.com/2016/02/trump-the-last-american/">The Last American</a>, is the last chance to keep the whole project limping along. And the Left won’t even let him do that.</p>
<p>We should be grateful for this. The real danger for the American Right is that we will be drafted into an effort to prop up this ramshackle project. If left to its own devices, there is no doubt the Republican Party, even with Trump at the head, will make things much worse. The likes of Paul Ryan <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/keep-your-government-hands-off-my-medicare-healthcare-reform-as-an-interracial-wealth-trans">will slash programs which benefit Whites</a>, supposedly to keep them sustainable for the Third World future. White Americans will fight and die against Russia in the name of our “fellow countrymen” like the BLM protesters of Chicago and Baltimore, and the hysterical mestizos in the foreign colony of <a href="http://www.radixjournal.com/altright-archive/altright-archive/main/blogs/zeitgeist/alien-nation">Los Angeles</a>. And Trump has no problem denouncing the Alt Right (albeit in a perfunctory, pro-forma way) while gushing over Blacks, Hispanics, and homosexuals as collective groups. Like the ethnic Germans in collapsing Austria-Hungary, a civic nationalism in the current context would simply lead to us being drafted in someone else’s fight.</p>
<p>Luckily, the hysterical Left is preparing the battlefield for us. With their refusal to accept Trump, sabotage of American institutions, and wild charges of treason, all but the most pathetic cuckservatives are being forced into a zero-sum struggle of peoples being waged on the North American continent. The main strategic objective of the Alt Right at this moment is, as Lawrence Murray brilliantly defined it, <a href="http://therightstuff.biz/2016/11/18/zero-to-eighty-eight-notes-on-building-a-deep-state/">to build a nationalist “deep state”</a> and use whatever power we can take as a weapon of “unrelenting ideological opportunism.” </p>
<p>After all, the Left has long since viewed the state in this way. In the Current Year, you pay taxes to support a government that makes your country less safe, your country less attractive, and your society more degraded. A progressive movement defined entirely by their hatred of European-Americans is telling us we don’t have anything in common with them; why not take them at their word? </p>
<p>Of course, a “deep state” is only one strategy among many. From secessionist movements to artistic subcultures, from building financial networks to self-sufficient tribes, a variety of strategies will be needed to survive what’s coming, some of which may even appear contradictory. What is clear is that Trump’s civic nationalist project is doomed before it even began, besieged from the Left by anti-White radicalism and from the supposed “Right” by Conservative Inc. functionaries devoid of racial or even national identity. </p>
<p>No one can predict exactly how this conflict will play out. But unless European-Americans cave entirely, the center will not hold. The System has already been stripped of legitimacy for both sides. And as Stephen Junger <a href="http://www.jack-donovan.com/axis/2016/06/tribalism-is-not-humanitarianism/">wrote</a> in <em>Tribe</em>, “People who speak with contempt for one another will probably not remain united for long.”</p><div class="">
