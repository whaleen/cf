<p>I am writing this column in Japan, a country whose crime rate is the lowest among countries with large populations. I asked my Japanese translator, a middle-aged woman, what she thought.</p>
<p>“Why is there is so little crime in Japan?” I asked.</p>
<p>Without taking a moment to reflect, she responded, “Because we don’t allow immigration.”</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Likewise in the United States, there is direct correlation between ethnic homogeneity and low levels of violence. According to 2016-2017 data, the four states with the lowest percentages of violence are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Vermont – where 95 percent of the population is one race (white).</li>
<li>Maine – where 95 percent of the population is one race (white).</li>
<li>Wyoming – where roughly 93 percent of the population is one race (white).</li>
<li>New Hampshire – where roughly 94 percent of the population is one race (white).</li>
</ol>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>All this leads to a particular rule, which is, in order to maintain a low crime rate and social stability, a country has only two choices: Do not allow immigrants into the country, or allow immigrants into the country, but be certain to assimilate them into the native population as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But since the 1960s, the left has supplanted e pluribus unum and its national American identity with the antithetical doctrines of diversity and multiculturalism.</p>
<p>Diversity and multiculturalism celebrate the national/ethnic identities of the nations from where American immigrants came instead of celebrating the American identity and traditional American values.</p>
<p>The result is the beginning of the end of the United States as we have known it since its inception.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Contrary to one of the left’s more mendacious claims, diversity has not been America’s great strength. America’s great strength has been forging an American identity out of diversity.</p>
<p>But the left, with its identity politics and commitment to multiculturalism – as expressed, for example, by ballots in dozens of languages, the proliferation of ethnic studies departments at universities and the allowance of all-black dorms and graduation ceremonies – is undoing that.</p>
<p>If you want to understand the immigration crisis, just know that because the left has undone the second choice, it has made the first choice – Japan’s choice – look tenable to many for the first time in American history.</p>
