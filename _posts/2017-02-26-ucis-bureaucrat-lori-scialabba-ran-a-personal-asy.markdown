<div class="pf-content"><p>The influence of VDare.com <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/lydia-brimelow-vdare-com-year-in-review">like its readership</a>, is growing and expanding. <a href="http://federaleagent86.blogspot.com/2017/02/trump-administration-follows-vdare-and.html">VDare.com and this writer</a> have apparently been on the reading lists of influential persons in the Trump Administration, to judge by their actions.The conservative media has also take the cue from the pioneering work at VDare.</p>
<p>Breitbart has dug into the treasonous bureaucracy at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and identified more saboteurs, something this blog revealed in two important posts [<em><a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/treason-and-sabotage-immigration-bureaucrats-acted-to-protect-san-bernardino-terrorists">President Trump Will Have Foes In Immigration Bureaucracy—But Also Friends. They Can Help Him Win</a>,</em> by Federale, VDare.com, April 25, 2017 and <em><a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/president-trump-will-have-foes-in-immigration-bureaucracy-but-also-friends-they-can-help-him-win">Treason and Sabotage: Immigration Bureaucrats Acted To Protect San Bernardino Terrorists</a>,</em> by Federale, VDare.com, July 5, 2016]. Breitbart ups the ante, and identifies major figures in the USCIS bureaucracy who are and will sabotage the Trump reforms at DHS.</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq"><p>Sources tell Breitbart News that the Department of Homeland Security, and in particular U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services [USCIS], is a hotbed of career open borders ideologues, many of whom intend to directly and indirectly subvert President Trump’s agenda.</p>
<p>“If you go down the list of current management at USCIS, probably 80 percent are open-borders left-wing ideologues,” a source, who has worked at the Department of Homeland Security for more than a decade and supports President Trump’s agenda, tells Breitbart News.</p>
<p>“USCIS probably has the most violent anti-border people in the United States. These are in the management. These do not believe in borders. I know them personally,” the source says.</p>
<p>“I am deeply concerned President Trump will not clean the deepest swamp, USCIS,” the source says:</p>
<p><em>[<a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/02/22/eight-more-obama-bureaucrats-donald-trump-can-remove-homeland-security/">8 More Obama Bureaucrats Trump Can Fire Or Remove At Homeland Security</a>,</em> by Michael Leahy, Breitbart, February 22, 2017]</p></blockquote>
<p>This writer disagrees with Leahy on one aspect of the report. While Lori Scialabba is indeed a major supporter of illegal aliens, refugees, and immigration fraud, the article is incorrect in claiming that the memorandum she wrote was sabotage of the Trump Executive orders.</p>
<p>Nothing in the Trump orders regarding the suspension of entry of aliens from the seven identified nations affected domestic adjudications of benefits. While this writer believes that the orders targeting entry by aliens from the targeted nations should have included more nations and should have included adjudications in the United States, the Trump Administration did not do that.</p>
<p>However, Leahy is otherwise quite correct on Scialabba, which I have myself confirmed with sources, especially her personal involvement in adjudications of applications for refugee or asylee status by individual Iraqi nationals and others. Such is unethical and highly improper, as well as suggestive of fraud and bribery, not an uncommon problem at USCIS.</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq"><p>In her previous position at USCIS, Director of Refugee Asylum and International Operations, “it was common knowledge that her email was directly available to anyone in the Iraqi community who wanted to apply for asylum,” the source adds.</p>
<p>“Iraqis that come into the country on visas were applying for asylum right away. Their cases would be denied because they didn’t qualify, they didn’t meet any of the five grounds for asylum. They didn’t have well founded fear, they weren’t persecuted,” the source notes.</p>
<p>“Any Iraqi that was denied asylum, they would email Scialabba directly. She would email her subordinates at the local offices, and those cases would be re-opened and approved, basically to please her,” the source said.</p><!-- TAG START { player: "7518-804336-VDare - Outstream - Rev", owner: "ONE Video by AOL", for: "ONE Video by AOL" - BEINJS } --><div id="57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4" class="vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539">    <script type="text/javascript" src="//delivery.vidible.tv/jsonp/pid=57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4/56bcd17ce4b018167fea5539_bein.js"></script></div><!-- TAG END { date: 07/25/16 } --></blockquote>
<p>More disturbing is that the Treason Bar has direct influence over her. Such direct appeals are illegal, as an denials have a formal process to go through:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq"><p>One attorney in one of the eight cities where local asylum approval officers were located appeared to have a direct line to Sciallabba as well. Iraqi immigrants would flock to that city because that particular lawyer, working through the local USCIS office, had a virtual 100 percent record of securing asylum approvals for Iraqis.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here is the correct appeals system:</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq"><p>Q. Can I do anything about an unfavorable decision issued by USCIS?<br />
A. Yes, you may file an appeal on some unfavorable decisions to the USCIS Administrative Appeals Office (AAO) or the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), an office within the Department of Justice. Your denial notice will provide information about whether the decision may be appealed and where to file your appeal.<br />
With certain exceptions, you may file a motion to reopen or motion to reconsider if you received an unfavorable decision in your case. You may file a motion with USCIS even if you do not have any appeal rights. You may also file a motion regarding a decision made on an appeal&#8230;</p>
<p>Q. How do I file an appeal?</p>
<p>A. Most appeals are filed on Form I-290B, Notice of Appeal or Motion, but there are some exceptions. Appeals of decisions on an N-400, Application for Naturalization, are made on Form N-336, Request for a Hearing on a Decision in Naturalization Proceedings. Appeals of decisions on an I-130, Petition for Alien Relative, or other decisions that are appealed to the BIA, are filed on Form EOIR-29, Notice of Appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals from a Decision of a DHS Officer, with the office that made the decision on the petition. When you are notified of an unfavorable decision that may be appealed, you will also receive information about which form you should use to appeal the decision.</p>
<p>Q. When do I file an appeal?</p>
<p>A. Generally, an appeal should be filed within 30 days from the date of the decision (not the date the decision was received). A shorter appeal period may apply to some cases. Your decision will tell you when the appeal period ends. There is no extension to this deadline. Only a brief to support a filed appeal may be submitted after the deadline.</p>
<p>[<a href="https://www.uscis.gov/forms/questions-and-answers-appeals-and-motions">Questions and Answers: Appeals and Motions</a>, USCIS Website]</p></blockquote>
<p>Direct appeals to managers without filing the proper forms is illegal and serious misconduct by any official who participates in such an &#8220;informal&#8221; appeal process. Such misconduct can be reported to the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General <a href="https://www.oig.dhs.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=51%3Ahotline-info&amp;catid=1&amp;Itemid=23">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can also ask Inspector General John Roth <a href="http://federaleagent86.blogspot.com/2017/01/convictions-in-san-bernardino-terrorist.html">as to the status of the DHS OIG investigation of Irene Martin</a>, a senior USCIS manager, and the other women managers at USCIS who acted to sabotage the investigation of the San Bernardino Terrorists, Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik.</p>
<p>USCIS and its bureaucrats will do all they can to sabotage President Trump. Time for him to replace their upper management with patriots from the enforcement components of USCIS as this writer has recommended, <a href="http://federaleagent86.blogspot.com/2016/12/taming-us-citizenship-and-immigration.html">along with other recommendations on how to reform USCIS</a>.</p>
