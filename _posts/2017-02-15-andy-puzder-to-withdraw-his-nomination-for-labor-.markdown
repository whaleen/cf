   This is great news: Fox News has learned that Andrew Puzder is expected to withdraw as Labor Secretary nominee, per @finnygo — Ben Florance (@benflorance) February 15, 2017 I never supported Andy Puzder and hoped the Senate would block his confirmation. Hopefully, Rep. Lou Barletta will reconsider and accept the nomination for Labor Secretary.           # => "I’ve been hurting to write this ever since we had the idea of creating a Planet for Cubox..." (Continued)
