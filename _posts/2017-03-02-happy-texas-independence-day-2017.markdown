<p>Today is Texas Independence Day, celebrating the day in 1836 when, as Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Independence_Day">recounts</a></p>
<blockquote><p> the adoption of the <a title="Texas Declaration of Independence" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Declaration_of_Independence">Texas Declaration of Independence</a> on March 2, 1836. With this document signed by 59 delegates, settlers in <a title="Mexican Texas" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Texas">Mexican Texas</a> officially declared independence from <a title="Mexico" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico">Mexico</a> and created the <a title="Republic of Texas" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Texas">Republic of Texas</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s important to remember that the Texans in this story, the <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/remembering-the-alamo-2">martyrs</a> of the <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/thinking-about-the-alamo-and-those-self-organizing-americans">Alamo</a>, and <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/san-jacinto-day-2015-texas-is-still-free-of-mexico-after-179-years8">victors </a>of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=San%20Jacinto,%20+site:vdare.com">San Jacinto,</a> were the Good Guys and the Mexicans were the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_L%C3%B3pez_de_Santa_Anna"> Bad Guys</a>. Not everybody in Texas feels that way:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hispanics, <strong>most of them of Mexican descent,</strong> surpassed Anglos as the largest ethnic group in the city [of Houston] in the 2000 census and are about 42 percent of the population. One of every three Texans is Hispanic, and <strong>they want a review of the Anglo-centric history the state has long celebrated.</strong> [<a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/3695327.html"><em>TEXAS INDEPENDENCE DAY 1836: The battle then and now</em></a> By LORI RODRIGUEZ, <em>Houston Chronicle</em>, March 2, 2006]</p><div id="57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4" class="vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539">    </div></blockquote>
<p>That being said, we shouldn’t forget the lesson the <a href="https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/uma01">Anglo settlers</a> in formerly “Mexican Texas” taught, which is that “Immigration Has Consequences”–see  Linda Thom’s <em><a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/lessons-from-a-short-history-of-texas">Lessons From A Short History Of Texas</a>,<br>
</em></p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/vdare-time-to-rethink-immigration-part-2"><em>Time to Rethink Immigration?</em></a> [June 22, 1992], <a title="View user profile." href="http://www.vdare.com/users/peter-brimelow">Peter Brimelow</a> quoted the <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Harvard-Encyclopedia-American-Ethnic-Groups/dp/0674375122/vd0b-20">Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups</a></em> to this effect:</p>
<blockquote><p>“In obtaining land grants in Texas, Anglo immigrants agreed to become Mexican citizens, obey Mexican laws, accept the <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/mary-queen-of-the-anglos">official Catholic faith,</a> learn Spanish, and take other steps to become fully assimilated as law-abiding citizens. However, over the years, it became clear that these settlers, now Anglo-Mexicans, were not becoming integrated into the nation and that Anglo immigration had become a problem . . . The strains and disagreements ultimately led to the Texas Revolution in 1835.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s what immigration meant to Mexico that year, and while Mexicans aren’t Texans, that’s what immigration could mean to America in some future year. Previous Texas Independence Day coverage:</p>
