<p>Immediately, the opposition began tweeting his remark. Opposition members present for Bannon&#8217;s quip, <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/reporters-claim-that-steve-bannon-just-walked-by-and-insulted-them/">according to</a> Mediaite&#8217;s Lindsey Ellefson, were the <em>Dallas News, NBC, Roll Call, CNN, The New York Times</em> and the <em>Daily Mail.</em></p>
<p>She ended her post with a bit of fake news: &#8220;Those outlets aren’t usually grouped together in any way, least of all as a unified party sharing any one ideology, oppositional or not, but this is a new era for the press and the people they serve.&#8221;</p>
<p>Right. The legacy media doesn&#8217;t have an ideology.</p>
