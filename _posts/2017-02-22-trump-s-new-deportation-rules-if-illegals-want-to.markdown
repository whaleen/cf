<div class="pf-content"><p>It again appears that John Kelly, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/john-kelly-youre-no-jumpin-joe-swing">is in over his head</a>. Kelly recently signed and released two memorandum regarding immigration law enforcement policy. Overall the memorandum reverse the <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/obama-s-administrative-amnesty-impeachment-is-the-only-answer">Obama Regime Administrative Amnesty</a>, except in one major area, the <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/national-data-deal-with-daca-with-heart-what-about-american-millennials">Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals (DACA) illegal aliens</a>, a major ongoing blunder by President Trump. Overall though, the memorandum put meat back on the table for DHS enforcement components.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.washingtonpost.com/video/c/embed/dbd92ed6-f88c-11e6-aa1e-5f735ee31334" width="480" height="290" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>First, the memorandums. The two memorandums effectively withdraw the infamous <a href="http://federaleagent86.blogspot.com/2010/06/official-guidance-on-non-feasance.html">Morton Memos</a> that ended interior immigration enforcement in the United States. All illegal aliens are subject to arrest. And I can confirm that in the run up to these memorandum, collateral arrests by enforcement components, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) have been making collateral arrests during enforcement actions, which is the arrest of random illegal aliens encountered while searching for other illegal aliens. Such was prohibited under Barack Hussein Obama and the infamous John Morton.</p>
<blockquote><p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is greatly expanding the number of people living in the U.S. illegally who are considered a priority for deportation, including people arrested for traffic violations, according to agency documents released Tuesday.</p>
<p>The documents represent a sweeping rewrite of the nation&#8217;s immigration enforcement priorities.</p>
<p>The Homeland Security Department memos, signed by Secretary John Kelly, lay out that any immigrant living in the United States illegally who has been charged or convicted of any crime — and even those suspected of a crime — will now be an enforcement priority. That could include people arrested for shop lifting or minor traffic offenses.</p>
<p>[<em><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/us-increase-number-immigrants-targeted-deportation-163654799--politics.html">US To Expand Pool Of People Targeted For Deportation</a>, A</em>licia Caldwell, Yahoo/Associated Press, February 21, 2017]</p></blockquote>
<p>And in a bit of press virtue signally, Caldwell calls for the Treason Bar and Mexico to interfere with the border security plan to force asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for their hearings:</p>
<blockquote><p>Kelly&#8217;s memo also describes plans to enforce a long-standing but obscure provision of the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act that allows the government to send some people caught illegally crossing the Mexican border back to Mexico, regardless of where they are from. One of the memos says that foreigners sent back to Mexico would wait for their U.S. deportation proceedings to be complete. This would be used for people who aren&#8217;t considered a threat to cross the border illegally again, the memo said.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear whether the United States has the authority to force Mexico to accept foreigners. That provision is almost certain to face opposition from civil libertarians and officials in Mexico.</p></blockquote>
<p>As I pointed out in an earlier post, Mexico can try and interfere with this plan, but America has options if Mexico refuses to accept back asylum seekers or Mexican nationals:</p>
<p>And if the Mexican government wants to play hardball, the U.S. can shut down the border, as it did when Mexican officials were slow to find abducted DEA Special Agent Kiki Camarena.[<em><a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/in-the-streets-and-the-courts-the-left-plans-a-coup-but-trump-can-fight-back">In The Streets And The Courts, The Left Plans A Coup.

<p>However, as soon as the new enforcement memos were released, saboteurs in DHS were meeting with the <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/take-the-debates-away-from-the-lying-press-they-do-take-a-side-period">Lying Press</a> to advise illegal aliens not to self-deport:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Trump administration sought to allay fears in immigrant communities Tuesday as it publicly released wide-ranging new guidelines that allow federal authorities to take stronger enforcement actions against illegal immigrants, saying the directives are not intended to produce mass deportations.</p>
<p>Federal officials cautioned that many of the changes detailed in a pair of memos signed by Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly will take time to implement and that other policies that grant agents and officers greater powers will be used with care and discretion.</p>
<p>[<em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-administration-seeks-to-prevent-panic-over-new-immigration-enforcement-policies/2017/02/21/a2a695a8-f847-11e6-bf01-d47f8cf9b643_story.html?utm_term=.33953811adb7">Trump Administration Seeks To Prevent ‘Panic’ Over New Immigration Enforcement Policies</a>,</em> by David Nakamura, WaPo, February 21, 2017]</p></blockquote>
<p>While these new announcements had the capacity in and of themselves to create panic, and subsequent self-deportation, some un-named DHS official did not want illegal aliens to self-deport:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We do not need a sense of panic in the communities,” a DHS official said in a conference call with reporters to formally release the memos to the public.</p>
<p>“We do not have the personnel, time or resources to go into communities and round up people and do all kinds of mass throwing folks on buses. That’s entirely a figment of folks’ imagination,” said the official, who was joined on the call by two others, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity to answer questions. “This is not intended to produce mass roundups, mass deportations.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, while it is true that not all illegal aliens can be deported, one of the purposes of enforcement action is to discourage illegal immigration and to cause illegal aliens to fear arrest and formal removal, then thereby leave on their own volition. Why this un-named official won&#8217;t go public is interesting and suggests he or she is a saboteur.</p>
<p>The reporter Nakamura has an interesting tweet on the briefing:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Reporters pointedly asked them to go on record but they declined. <a href="https://t.co/YJqSdKQKnz">https://t.co/YJqSdKQKnz</a></p>
<p>&mdash; David Nakamura (@DavidNakamura) <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidNakamura/status/834099252812996609">February 21, 2017</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Despite this being an apparently official briefing for the press, and not the usual &#8220;un-named source,&#8221; reportage, Nakamura refuses to identify that official. It appears Nakamura and the WaPo are playing the Washington insider game; in this case Nakamura and others in the press are attempting to influence policy rather than reporting news. And they are surprised that people think they are the <em><a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/all-lies-matter-fight-the-lying-press">Lugenpresse</a></em>.</p>
<p>Contact Nakamura <a href="mailto:david.nakamura@washpost.com">here</a> and ask him why the name of an official briefer on a conference call for large numbers of press officials was not named.</p>
<p>For immigration enforcement to work, <a href="http://federaleagent86.blogspot.com/2012/03/scaring-illegals-away.html">as with Operation Wetback</a>, half of those who leave do so out of fear, fear of being arrested and deported. The Trump Administration needs to realize that.</p>
