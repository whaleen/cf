<p>Two British doctors have been killed in <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/iraq"><strong>Iraq</strong></a> after leaving their studies in Sudan to join <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/isis"><strong>Islamic State</strong></a> fighters, it has been reported.</p>
<p>Ahmed Sami Khider and Hisham Fadlallah are said to have died at the weekend.</p>
<p>Khider, a former student at Wallington County Grammar School in south London, had been working in Mosul and was reportedly hit by gunfire while travelling in a convoy trying to leave the city, the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-39131251?ns_mchannel=social&amp;ns_campaign=bbc_breaking&amp;ns_source=twitter&amp;ns_linkname=news_central"><strong>BBC</strong></a> reports.</p>
<p>He was one of nine students – seven of them British – from a university in Sudan to flee the country and join Islamic State fighters in Syria after graduating in mid-2014.</p>
<p>His parents – including his doctor father – have travelled to Khartoum, Sudan, for “a period of mourning”, the broadcaster said.</p>
<p>The circumstances of the death of Fadlallah, from Nottinghamshire, were unclear.</p>
<p>Khider had starred wearing a doctor’s stethoscope in an ISIS film urging other Brit doctors to travel to Syria and Iraq to fight the West soon after he arrived in the region.</p>
<p>Sitting in front of a large desk, the doctor was clean shaven and spoke in flawless English about the different medical facilities in Syria.</p>
<p>“I send greetings from the Islamic State, to all my dear brothers and sisters within the Islamic State and outside.</p>
<p>“There is actually a really good medical service being provided here. Lots of hospitals, lots of services provided.”</p>
<p>He warned recruits: “the caravan is leaving and I hope I will see you all here, all the doctors helping out.”</p>
<p>A friend told the BBC that Khider was popular and influential at university.</p>
<p>“All of the boys in particular looked up to him,” he said.</p>
<p>“They all listened to what he said and took it to heart.</p>
<p>“Everyone loved him. He became a leader.”</p>
