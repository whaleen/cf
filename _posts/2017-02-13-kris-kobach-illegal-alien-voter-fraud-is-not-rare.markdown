   &lt;div class=&quot;pf-content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the mainstream media, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.limitstogrowth.org/articles/2017/02/11/texas-mexican-woman-is-sentenced-to-8-years-for-voter-fraud/&quot;&gt;conviction of an illegal alien Mexican for multiple instances of unlawful voting&lt;/a&gt; was a one-off case — no reason for the citizens to worry their little heads about widespread foreigner voting. The &lt;i&gt;no problema&lt;/i&gt; characterization was favored by the Obama administration of course because of its open-borders policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, there is a real problem, according to Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, who has investigated the crime locally. He discussed the results of his inquiries into voter fraud in Kansas on Monday with Fox News. The shockeroo headline: &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;18,000 illegal aliens registered to vote (or attempted to register) in Kansas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/PST045216/20&quot;&gt;population 2.9 million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, President Trump is engaged on this issue and how to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRIAN KILMEADE: You got a Mexican citizen living in Texas sent to prison for voting at least five times here in America. So why are so many in the media working to cover up these stores? Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach joins us right now live. Kris, you saw a lot of the dust-up over the weekend between the administration and various talk show hosts. They don’t believe there’s anything to it, there’s no proof that this happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KRIS KOBACH: There’s tons of proof that it happens. In Kansas we’re fighting the ACLU in a number of lawsuits so we have actually been presenting cases like this to a federal court and you mentioned the one case in Texas — we’ve got 115 cases of known non-citizens who either got on our voter rolls in Kansas or who attempted to get on our voter rolls, and that’s just the tip of the iceberg because you can’t discover most of the cases. &lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff0000;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;We had a statistical analysis done of our entire voter rolls and it looks like we have as many as 18,000 cases of aliens on our voter rolls or people who attempted to get on the voter rolls and are not citizens.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4&quot; class=&quot;vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539&quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we’re just a small state. Brian, population-wise so if you take those numbers, you extrapolate to a state like Texas or California, you’re probably talking about hundreds of thousands of non-citizens on the voter rolls, and you’re absolutely right — the media on the left wants to just ignore it and say oh there’s no proof. No, we’re presenting proof in federal court, but they don’t want to put any attention on it.&lt;span id=&quot;more-14741&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KILMEADE: How do we end up on opposite sides of this issues? Republicans and Democrats should be on the same page on this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KOBACH: You would think so. I don’t know why the Democrats don’t want to acknowledge this problem — perhaps it’s because they think they benefit from the problem — I don’t know. Who knows? The point is, it’s a proven reality, and in the one way we can solve it is by having proof of citizenship so when a person registers to vote, at the time of the registration they provide proof of citizenship. We do that in Kansas; there are three other states that do it: Arizona, Alabama and Georgia. But we should be doing this in all 50 states and there’s no good reason not to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KILMEADE: Kris, have you been asked by the vice president to help him with his special counsel to look into this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KOBACH: I haven’t spoken with the vice president, but I’ve actually spoken with the president himself about this problem and we’ve talked about various ways you can go after this problem — you can find those people who are criminally voting illegally — and by the way many of the people in Kansas also have been voting on multiple elections we have found. So, yes there is a way to go after it and I think the federal government will do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
