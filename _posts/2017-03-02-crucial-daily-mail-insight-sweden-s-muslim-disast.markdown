<div class="pf-content">

_Real Clear Politics_ deserves a lot of credit today for not being distracted entirely by the Trump speech last night and featuring an important _Daily Mail_ piece with the imposing headline [_Where females fear to tread: KATIE HOPKINS reports from Sweden, the Scandi-lib paradise where terrified women have vanished from the streets and a conspiracy of silence and self-censorship on immigration buries the truth_](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4269576/KATIE-HOPKINS-reports-Scandi-lib-paradise-Sweden.html) by Katie Hopkins 28 February. 2017  

Since President Trump broke the US _MSM_ taboo and drew America’s attention to the catastrophic situation in Sweden there have been a number of posts in the blogosphere seeking to back him up, for instance the Gatestone Institute’s [_Europe: Laughing at the Messenger_](https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/9988/sweden-trump) by Douglas Murray February 28, 2017 and, for us, [_Trump, Sweden, And Our Ableist, Insulated Media_](http://www.vdare.com/articles/trump-sweden-and-our-ableist-insulated-media) by John Derbyshire February 25, 2017.

But what I like about the _Daily Mail_ essay is that notwithstanding its bright human-interest tabloid presentation the root cause of Sweden’s Muslim Immigration disaster is highlighted:

> One young girl of 27 — let’s call her Lucy— is now terrified of going out alone. She lives near a busy shopping centre which draws migrants from no-go zones, and dreads her walk to work and home…
> 
> She knows the latest rape cases by heart, quotes them to me, the words tumbling out, a long line of horrible happenings. She is waiting for her turn to be added to the list…
> 
> Her apartment was broken into last week in the middle of the day…. The police told her they were too busy to come.
> 
> **_She doesn’t want her picture to be seen now_**. Not in case the migrants attack again, but _**because the feminists will come after her and hound her as a racist for speaking out.**_ The migrant men scare her. But _**it is Swedish women who have silenced her.**_
> 
> (VDARE.com emphasis)

Hopkins acquired a gem of an example of this PC crippling:

> I ran to the scene of an unexploded hand grenade in a bin outside the police station of a no-go area of town, near a mosque. I asked the police who the target was.
> 
> They said they didn’t know. I asked the Muslim leader at the mosque. He said he thought it was the police.
> 
> Then two women grabbed me and told me not to make this about the mosque, not to make this a Muslim issue. This was about the police — nothing to do with migrants.
> 
> A cameraman for the Swedish equivalent of the BBC asked me why this had to be politicised at all; why couldn’t it just be that someone put an explosive device in a bin?
> 
> I looked at him and wondered which one of us was mad.

Hopkins has more familiar anecdotes:

> One lady explained: there is a strange moral code here in Rinkeby [scene of [last weekend’s riots](http://www.vdare.com/posts/huge-immigrant-riots-break-out-in-perfectly-safe-sweden)]. You are much more exposed to crime if you are not a Muslim. These boys think they can take everything from a woman who is not wearing a hijab or at least covers her hair.

However to my mind there is a great truth here: the Swedes did this to themselves. They will not be able to correct matters until they change.

All eerily predicted in Roland Huntford’s great 1971 book [_The New Totalitarians_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Totalitarians) [[PDF _here_](http://eindtijdinbeeld.nl/EiB-Bibliotheek/Boeken/The_New_Totalitarians__Brave_New_Sweden___1980_.pdf)]. And this could easily happen here.

_Real Clear Politics_ deserves applause for picking up this story. They seem to be casting their net wider: yesterday they picked up our old friend [Joe Guzzardi’](http://www.vdare.com/users/joe-guzzardi)s _Arizona Republic_ article _[Everything Trump says seems possible](http://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/2017/02/28/trump-agenda/98403550/)_

Maybe one day VDARE.com will not be taboo!
