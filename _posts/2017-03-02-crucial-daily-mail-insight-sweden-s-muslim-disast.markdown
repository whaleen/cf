<div class="pf-content"><p>H/T Pic <em>Daily Mail</em></p>
<p><em>Real Clear Politics</em> deserves a lot of credit today for not being distracted entirely by the Trump speech last night and featuring an important <em>Daily Mail</em> piece with the imposing headline <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4269576/KATIE-HOPKINS-reports-Scandi-lib-paradise-Sweden.html"><em>Where females fear to tread: KATIE HOPKINS reports from Sweden, the Scandi-lib paradise where terrified women have vanished from the streets and a conspiracy of silence and self-censorship on immigration buries the truth</em> </a>by Katie Hopkins 28 February. 2017</p>
<p>Since President Trump broke the US <em>MSM</em> taboo and drew America’s attention to the catastrophic situation in Sweden there have been a number of posts in the blogosphere seeking to back him up, for instance the Gatestone Institute’s<a href="https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/9988/sweden-trump"><em> Europe: Laughing at the Messenger</em> </a>by Douglas Murray February 28, 2017 and, for us,<a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/trump-sweden-and-our-ableist-insulated-media"><em> Trump, Sweden, And Our Ableist, Insulated Media</em></a> by John Derbyshire February 25, 2017.</p>
<p>But what I like about the <em>Daily Mail</em> essay is that notwithstanding its bright human-interest tabloid presentation the root cause of Sweden’s Muslim Immigration disaster is highlighted:</p>
<blockquote><p>One young girl of 27 — let’s call her Lucy— is now terrified of going out alone. She lives near a busy shopping centre which draws migrants from no-go zones, and dreads her walk to work and home…</p>
<p>She knows the latest rape cases by heart, quotes them to me, the words tumbling out, a long line of horrible happenings. She is waiting for her turn to be added to the list…</p>
<p>Her apartment was broken into last week in the middle of the day…. The police told her they were too busy to come.</p>
<p><strong><em>She doesn’t want her picture to be seen now</em></strong>. Not in case the migrants attack again, but <em><strong>because the feminists will come after her and hound her as a racist for speaking out.</strong></em> The migrant men scare her. But <em><strong>it is Swedish women who have silenced her.</strong></em></p><div id="57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4" class="vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539">    </div>
<p>(VDARE.com emphasis)</p></blockquote>
<p>Hopkins acquired a gem of an example of this PC crippling:</p>
<blockquote><p>I ran to the scene of an unexploded hand grenade in a bin outside the police station of a no-go area of town, near a mosque. I asked the police who the target was.</p>
<p>They said they didn’t know. I asked the Muslim leader at the mosque. He said he thought it was the police.</p>
<p>Then two women grabbed me and told me not to make this about the mosque, not to make this a Muslim issue. This was about the police — nothing to do with migrants.</p>
<p>A cameraman for the Swedish equivalent of the BBC asked me why this had to be politicised at all; why couldn’t it just be that someone put an explosive device in a bin?</p>
<p>I looked at him and wondered which one of us was mad.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hopkins has more familiar anecdotes:</p>
<blockquote><p>One lady explained: there is a strange moral code here in Rinkeby [scene of <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/huge-immigrant-riots-break-out-in-perfectly-safe-sweden">last weekend’s riots</a>]. You are much more exposed to crime if you are not a Muslim. These boys think they can take everything from a woman who is not wearing a hijab or at least covers her hair.</p></blockquote>
<p>However to my mind there is a great truth here: the Swedes did this to themselves. They will not be able to correct matters until they change.</p>
<p>All eerily predicted in Roland Huntford’s great 1971 book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Totalitarians"><em>The New Totalitarians</em></a> [<a href="http://eindtijdinbeeld.nl/EiB-Bibliotheek/Boeken/The_New_Totalitarians__Brave_New_Sweden___1980_.pdf">PDF <em>here</em></a>]. And this could easily happen here.</p>
<p><em>Real Clear Politics</em> deserves applause for picking up this story. They seem to be casting their net wider: yesterday they picked up our old friend <a href="http://www.vdare.com/users/joe-guzzardi">Joe Guzzardi’</a>s <em>Arizona Republic</em> article <em><a href="http://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/2017/02/28/trump-agenda/98403550/">Everything Trump says seems possible</a></em></p>
<p>Maybe one day VDARE.com will not be taboo!</p>
