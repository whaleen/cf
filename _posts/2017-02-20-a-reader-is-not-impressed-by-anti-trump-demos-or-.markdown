<p>That&#8217;s funny.  Shows no respect? Yeah, how about all those disrespecting our laws and sovereignty by illegally entering the country?</p>
<p>I talk with many  friends   in the construction industry who are fed up with having to compete with cheap labor who for the most part aren&#8217;t very good at what they do.  I just spent another $600 to repair the work that some incompetent Mexican workers did to my bathroom remodel.  I learned after talking candidly with a supervisor who told me they didn&#8217;t use E-Verify because they preferred to use cheaper illegal alien labor and could fire them at will and not pay them.</p>
<p>I wish I could have taped the conversation and then reported it to ICE.</p>
<p>Oh well my repairs are so much better now that I have a competent American to do the work!</p>
