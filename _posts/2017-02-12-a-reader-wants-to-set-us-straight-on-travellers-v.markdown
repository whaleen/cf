That’s wrong. Not that it surprises me that the MSM can’t be bothered to even look up Wikipedia to find that out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Irish_Travellers&amp;amp;oldid=762314803&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Irish travellers do not have links to Roma or Romani people&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Population genetics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A genetic analysis of Irish Travellers found evidence to support the hypotheses of: (1) Irish ancestry; (2) several distinct subpopulations; and (3) the distinctiveness of the midland counties due to Viking influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetic studies by Miriam Murphy, David Croke, and other researchers identified certain genetic diseases such as galactosemia that are more common in the Irish Traveller population, involving identifiable allelic mutations that are rarer among the rest of the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4&quot; class=&quot;vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539&quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two main hypotheses have arisen, speculating whether:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this resulted from marriages made largely within and among the Traveller community, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;suggesting descent from an original Irish carrier long ago with ancestors unrelated to the rest of the Irish population.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They concluded that: “The fact that Q188R is the sole mutant allele among the Travellers as compared to the non-Traveller group may be the result of a founder effect in the isolation of a small group of the Irish population from their peers as founders of the Traveller sub-population. This would favour the second, endogenous, hypothesis of Traveller origins.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically, they found that Q188R was found in 100% of Traveller samples, and in 89% of other Irish samples, indicating that the Traveller group was typical of the larger Irish indigenous population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
