<p>As I am sure you are all aware, on the day of the Presidential Inauguration our very own <a href="http://www.altright.com/2017/01/20/richard-spencer-assaulted-in-washington-dc/">Richard Spencer was assaulted</a> in Washington, DC while giving an interview. Surrounded by self- proclaimed anti-fascists, aka "antifa" who were waving signs that read "White Lives Matter Too Much", a masked man cowardly sucker-punched Richard Spencer and ran off. The story blew up Twitter, meanwhile Washington was left in flames and broken glass from antifa who were protesting President-elect, now President, Donald Trump from being sworn into office.</p>
<p>You can already hear the likes of Paul Joseph Watson of InfoWars, in his British accent, complaining about "the intolerant Left" and how they are simply avoiding having a debate about ideas. Paul is certainly right about that. But so what? This is a new age in American politics. We no longer live in a nation where friends and family can gather around the dinner table, discuss politics, and simply agree to disagree about some issues (or perhaps even convince one another that the other has a point - shock!). Oh no, those days are no more. The age of Reason is over.</p>
<p>This is bad news for those who fancy themselves as "rational skeptics" or classical liberals. They now find themselves in the ever-shrinking middle ground of politics. Slowly but surely, they are losing grounds to political radicals like antifa, the alt-right, or the various ethno-cultural voting blocks that exist in the US. Sorry Paul, no matter how convincing or sound your classical liberal logic and reason is, you are never going to convince more than 10% of Blacks to support your politics. The center cannot hold. So what are the likes of Paul going to do?</p>
<p>It seems the antifa are going to make that choice for them. The night before the inauguration, some of the "alt-lite" personalities - Mike Cernovich, Milo Yiannopoulos, Lauren Southern, Gavin McInnes, and others, held a party titled the "DeploraBall" at the National Press Club. This party became the target of an antifa plot. Thanks are due to James O'Keefe, of Project Veritas, for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHZSfhd1X_8">uncovering the antifa terrorist plot</a> to put butyric acid in the ventilation system of the National Press Club. Butyric acid is the ingredient used in stink bombs. While it is unlikely anyone would have been harmed, the intention of the antifa was to cause mayhem and incite political fear in the DeploraBall attendees. This is the textbook definition of terrorism. It turns out that supporting Donald Trump for President makes you a de facto Nazi according to antifa, and that alone grants them the sense of moral righteousness to commit acts of terrorism and violence against you.</p>
<p>What do so-called rationalist classical liberals do when confronted with an extremely irrational political foe? I guess we will find out in due time. I will say that complaining about the "intolerant left" as they are bashing your heads in, setting fires, and smashing windows is
probably not going to get you very far. They aren't really interested in hearing how you are "one of the good Trump supporters" unlike those "bad people" over there, like Richard Spencer. To them, you are equally as deplorable as Richard Spencer. I mean, come on, you did vote for Literally Hitler TM over the almost First Female President, Hillary Clinton... and anyone who voted for Literally Hitler TM is a Nazi too! No amount of reasoning with these degenerates is going to change their minds.</p>
<p>The alt-right has its disagreements with the various personalities in the cultural libertarian movement. However, we are still willing to agree to disagree with you. We are not committing acts of violence against you (the alt-right is the religion of peace!) Meanwhile, le edgy faggot, Milo Yiannopoulos is having his speaking tour interrupted by violent antifa on a semi-regular basis. It's only a matter of time before someone is seriously harmed at one of his events (oops,<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/suspect-custody-trump-protest-shooting-milo-yiannopoulos-event-seattle-police/">too late</a>).</p>
<p>I know this is a lot to ask of the alt-lite but it's time to snap out of it already. It's time to drop the rationalist way of looking at the world. That way of thinking is quickly becoming outdated. We are slowly finding ourselves moving closer and closer to civil war. There is already an unspoken civil war taking place as we speak. We see interracial violence in our country on a daily basis.</p>
<p>We are now beginning to see antifa move their cross-hairs from the likes of Richard Spencer to the likes of the everyday normal Trump supporter. There is no going back folks. The America you grew up loving where you could freely speak about ideas with one another is dead. We now live in the age of the soft totalitarianism of Political Correctness. However, that totalitarianism is quickly losing its softness as we find antifa have gleefully stepped into the role of the modern-day Cheka of the managerial state. It's time to realize that there is not going to be a rational and logical discussion about the future of the USA, Europe, or Western Civilization. Our political opponents are emotionally and spiritually invested in seeing that we are all destroyed. This is the reality of the situation we find ourselves in. It is time to act accordingly.</p><div class="">
