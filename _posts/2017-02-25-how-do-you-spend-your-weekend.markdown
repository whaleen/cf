<p>As co-founder of Hotwire.com and CEO of Zillow for the last seven years, 39-year-old Spencer Rascoff fits most people’s definition of success. As a father of three young children, Spencer is a busy guy at home and at work.</p>
<p>What’s the one thing that Spencer refuses to do on the weekend? Work—at least, in the traditional sense.</p>
<p>Jacquelyn Smith shared some interesting insights from Spencer in <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2013/02/22/14-things-successful-people-do-on-weekends/">her article</a> on how successful people spend their weekends:</p>
<p>“I never go into the office on weekends,” Spencer says, “but I do check e-mail at night. My weekends are an important time to unplug from the day-to-day and get a chance to think more deeply about my company and my industry. Weekends are a great chance to reflect and be more introspective about bigger issues.”</p>
<p><em><strong><a href="http://www.cmi-gold-silver.com/gold-confiscation-1933/?utm_source=LRC&amp;utm_medium=textad&amp;utm_campaign=Myths">Myths, Misunderstandings and Outright lies about owning Gold. Are you at risk? </a></strong></em></p>
<p>A <a href="http://ftp.iza.org/dp8129.pdf">new study</a> from Stanford shows that Rascoff is on to something.</p>
<p>The study found that productivity per hour declines sharply when the workweek exceeds 50 hours, and it drops off so much after 55 hours that there’s no point in working any more. That’s right, people who work as much as 70 hours (or more) per week actually get the same amount done as people who work 55 hours. Those extra hours are wasted.</p>
<p>Successful people know the importance of shifting gears on the weekend to relaxing and rejuvenating activities. Like Spencer, they use their weekends to create a better week ahead.</p>
<p>This is easier said than done, so here’s some help. The following list contains 10 things that successful people do to find balance on the weekend and to come into work at 110% on Monday morning.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>1. They Wake Up at the Same Time</strong></p>
<p>It’s tempting to sleep in on the weekend to catch up on your sleep. Though it feels good temporarily, having an inconsistent wake-up time disturbs your circadian rhythm. Your body cycles through an elaborate series of sleep phases in order for you to wake up rested and refreshed. One of these phases involves preparing your mind to be awake and alert, which is why people often wake up just before their alarm clock goes off (the brain is trained and ready). When you sleep past your regular wake-up time on the weekend, you end up feeling groggy and tired. This isn’t just disruptive to your day off, it also makes you less productive on Monday because your brain isn’t ready to wake up at your regular time. If you need to catch up on sleep, just go to bed earlier.</p>
<p><strong>2. They Designate Mornings as <em>Me </em>Time</strong></p>
<p>It can be difficult to get time to yourself on the weekends, especially if you have a family. Finding a way to engage in an activity you’re passionate about first thing in the morning can pay massive dividends in happiness and cleanliness of mind. It’s also a great way to perfect your circadian rhythm by forcing yourself to wake up at the same time you do on weekdays. Your mind achieves peak performance two-to-four hours after you wake up, so get up early to do something physical, and then sit down and engage in something mental while your mind is at its peak.</p>
<p><strong>3. They Schedule Micro-Adventures</strong></p>
<p>Buy tickets to a concert or play, or get reservations for that cool new hotel that just opened downtown. Instead of running on a treadmill, plan a hike. Try something you haven’t done before or perhaps something you haven’t done in a long time. Studies show that anticipating something good to come is a significant part of what makes the activity pleasurable. Knowing that you have something interesting planned for Saturday will not only be fun come Saturday, but it will significantly improve your mood throughout the week.</p>
<p><strong>4. They Pursue a Passion</strong></p>
<p>You might be surprised what happens when you pursue something you’re passionate about on weekends. Indulging your passions is a great way to escape the stress and to open your mind to new ways of thinking. Things, like playing music, reading, writing, painting, or even playing catch with your kids, can help stimulate different modes of thought that can reap huge dividends over the coming week.</p>
