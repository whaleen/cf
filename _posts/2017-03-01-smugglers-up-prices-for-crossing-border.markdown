<p>The tariffs charged by smugglers, known as <em>coyotes</em> or <em>polleros</em>, to get migrants across the border through the mountains have increased close to 130%, reports the newspaper Reforma. Last November the fee was of US $3,500 but by January smugglers were charging up to $8,000, under the argument that new policies in the U.S. made the illegal crossing riskier.</p>
<p>Those who plan to enter the U.S. through border crossings — using documents of individuals with whom they have a close physical resemblance — are being charged more than $12,000.</p>
<p>Along with the increased costs migrants must face the risk of being kidnapped and tortured.</p>
<p>One of those who has seen it all is Efrén Guevara Galindo, who arrived in the U.S. as an eight-month-old baby, He has since been deported four times.</p>
<p>The last time for the 50-year-old construction worker was last December when he was deported from Dallas, Texas, to Acuña, Coahuila.</p>
<p>While trying to return to the U.S. from Ojinaga, Chihuahua, Guevara was kidnapped with other migrants by a criminal group identified as La Línea.</p>
<p>He and three others got off a bus and walked a few blocks before they were nabbed and spirited away in trucks to a nearby ranch.</p>
<p>“. . . we could hear people in other rooms, from Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala. I could hear them talking because every 10 or 15 minutes [the criminals] took one of them out and made them call their families.”</p>
<p>Guevara said their kidnappers demanded $20,000 to let the Central American migrants go, and $10,000 for the Mexicans.</p>
<p>Guevara said he was assaulted trying to defend a 70-year-old man from the criminals, kicked several times and injured with a knife. After another beating he was left behind for dead in a remote location.</p>
<p>He is now recovering in a migrants’ shelter in Tijuana, Baja California, where he has decided not to cross the border again.</p>
