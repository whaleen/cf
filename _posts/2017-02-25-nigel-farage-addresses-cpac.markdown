In his own country, Nigel Farage has been a thorn in the side of the Tories. As with President Trump, who cancelled on CPAC 2016 after a storm of opposition from #TruCons who supported Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and Steve Bannon who organized the &#8220;Uninvited&#8221; at CPAC 2013, the fact that Nigel Farage is speaking at CPAC is a symptom of how the global national populist revolution is sweeping aside &#8220;conservative&#8221; parties all over the Western world. It has already happened in the United States. The European Spring will be the big story of 2017.<div class="">
