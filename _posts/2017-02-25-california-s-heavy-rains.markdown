<p class="mol-para-with-font">In recent weeks, California has experienced unusually heavy rainfall.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">California is also earthquake-prone, hosting the great San Andreas fault zone.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">If there is an unusual surge of earthquakes in the near future – allowing time for the rain to percolate deep into faults – California may well become an interesting laboratory to study possible connections between weather and earthquakes.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">The effect is likely to be subtle and will require sophisticated computer modeling and statistical analysis.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Earthquakes are triggered by a tiny additional increment of stress added to a fault already loaded almost to breaking point.</p>

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Many natural processes can provide this tiny increment of stress, including the movement of plate tectonics, a melting icecap, and even human activities.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">For example, injecting water into boreholes – either for waste disposal or to drive residual oil out of depleted reservoirs – is particularly likely to trigger earthquakes.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">This is because water pressure in the fault zone is important in controlling when a geological fault slips.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Fault zones invariably contain groundwater, and if the pressure of this water increases, the fault may become &#8216;unclamped.&#8217;</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">The two sides are then free to slip past each other, causing an earthquake.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Hydrological changes do not need to be sudden or large to change the water pressure in a fault zone.</p>
