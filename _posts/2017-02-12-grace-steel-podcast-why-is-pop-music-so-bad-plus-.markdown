   &lt;div class=&quot;pf-content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Episode 69 of my podcast is &lt;a href=&quot;http://2kevins.com/archives/979&quot;&gt;now posted here&lt;/a&gt; (with copious links) and &lt;a title=&quot;&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLUgV5lVymc&quot;&gt;on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. Anyone who has observed men at work (construction, home renovation, plumbing, etc.) will have noticed that the music they listen to is old. Decades old, usually. Creedence Clearwater Revival, Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, &lt;em&gt;und so weiter&lt;/em&gt;. Now why might that be? I have considered this phenomenon for quite some time and concluded that the music industry decided to shut out straight, white males circa 2000, which is about the time that pop music stopped being any good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popular music today is created for women, particularly teenage and preteen girls, blacks and gays, as they are easier to manipulate. Men, being harder to please, have been deemed surplus to requirements. Before 2000, much of what is deemed the best of popular music came about as the result of accidents unforeseen by the industry: rock and roll, the British Invasion and the garage bands, punk and new wave and, finally, grunge. The record industry doesn’t like accidents, as they make planning difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s pop music is planned to an obsessive degree. Go to Wikipedia and peruse the credits for any best-selling records. You might ask yourself why Keith Urban needs seven writers (Mikkel Storleer Eriksen, Tor Erik Hermansen, Benjamin Levine, Ammar Malik, Dan Omelio, Ross Golan, Justin Parker) and three producers (Keith Urban, Stargate and Benny Blanco) for a 183-second opus called “Shame.” The reason is that ever since Carlos Santana’s 1999 smash-hit-by-committee &lt;em&gt;Supernatural&lt;/em&gt;, the industry has concluded that hit-making is now SCIENCE! Draft a bunch of Swedes and others thought to be in tune with the zeitgeist, lay on the hooks with a trowel, and success is guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the event, pop music has become meta. There is little interest in anymore music qua music. Instead, recordings have become mere tokens of one’s devotion to stars such as Katy Perry, who hardly needs music to be famous, given her cosmetics ads and the ubiquity on the Internet of her handsome body and pretty face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bourgeois audience that once supported the artistic pretensions of everyone from Frank Sinatra to the Rolling Stones to Nirvana has disappeared. We live in an age that is resolutely anti-art, an age when cultural arbiters have been replaced by snarky, post-modern hipsters. Some argue that the Age of Trump will result in a return of protest music. It seems more likely to me that the return of masculinity signalled by Trump’s triumph will result in a return of heterosexuality to popular music. But that might be wishful thinking on my part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4&quot; class=&quot;vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539&quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
