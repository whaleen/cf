<p>For all of the talk of the &#8220;Deep State&#8221; and its influence removal of Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn (ret.) as National Security Advisor, I dare hope for a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>While some believe that our greatest national security threat comes from either the Bear or the Dragon, it is mass immigration that threatens the very existence of the historic American nation itself. Many were disappointed to see Gen. John Kelly appointed as DHS Secretary, and it may well have been <a href="http://gotnews.com/breaking-senjohnmccain-lindseygrahamsc-blocked-realdonaldtrumps-1st-dhs-pick-kriskobach1787-amnesty/">the tip of the iceberg</a> that is the Deep State to <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article124637634.html">blame</a> for this.</p><!-- TAG START { player: "7518-804336-VDare - Outstream - Rev", owner: "ONE Video by AOL", for: "ONE Video by AOL" - BEINJS } --><div id="57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4" class="vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539">    <script type="text/javascript" src="//delivery.vidible.tv/jsonp/pid=57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4/56bcd17ce4b018167fea5539_bein.js"></script></div><!-- TAG END { date: 07/25/16 } -->
<p>But the National Security Advisor does not require Senate confirmation, and Kris Kobach of Kansas would be well suited for this job. While he may not have a military background, neither did past officeholder <a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Condoleezza%20Rice.+site:vdare.com">Condoleezza Rice.</a> A bold move like this would instantly embolden the base, and confound any on the left who think they have pulled off their first victory over this Administration.</p>
