<p>This past July, Richard Spencer chalked up an impressive feat for any heretic: <a href="http://therightstuff.biz/2016/07/14/the-perma-ban-of-richard-spencer/">getting perma-banned</a> from an entire country, in this case the UK. In a letter from current Prime Minister Theresa May to Spencer, in which she explained her diktat, May declared Spencer in violation of an “Unacceptable Behavior” policy. More specifically, May cited Spencer’s call for a European homeland on the North American continent as the primary reason for the ban. Without further elaboration or explanation, it was claimed that this call may have somehow fostered intercommunity violence in the UK. Spencer’s very presence in the country was therefore deemed not to be “conducive to the public good.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, what increasingly appears to be acceptable behavior in the eyes of the British government is the endemic use of hard drugs. As reported by <em><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/drug-testing-booths-nightclubs-to-check-purity-safety-of-cocaine-and-mdma-a7457791.html">the Independent</a></em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nightclubs in Preston are to offer free drug testing to people who want to know if their Class A substances are pure.</p>
<p>The walk-in booths, run by a charity, will aim to reduce drug-related deaths by checking cocaine and MDMA are not “adulterated or highly potent”. </p>
<p>Lancashire police have reportedly said they are backing the scheme, which will operate in the city centre on Friday and Saturday nights from the beginning of next year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article goes on to say that a similar service had 300 users last summer. Moreover, about 2,250 people per year die in the UK from drug misuse, triple the levels since records of this type began in 1993. This begs the question: if one is to ban persons or events that are not conducive to the public good, should then-Home Secretary May not have focused instead on nightclubs and music festivals that spread this lethal degeneracy? <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/318277946/Banned-in-the-UK#fullscreen&amp;from_embed">Or is the following more dangerous</a>?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We need an ethno-state so that our people can “come home again,” can live amongst family -- to put it banally, so that they can feel safe and secure. But we also need an Ethno-state so that Whites can again reach the stars.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Safety. Security. Destiny. But what is most at odds with modernity is this idea of a “people,” something that societal poisons such as cocaine and MDMA break down on a grand scale. The UK, while not yet adopting this policy nationwide, is officially signaling their accommodation of hard drug use – and all the health risks, stunted personal development, social anomie, and actual intercommunity violence that comes with its use and trade.</p>
<p>What we ultimately learn from this is that the UK government can tolerate a self-poisoning mass of individuals, but what they cannot confront is a healthy, strong, and united people. Such a force would overturn their decadent and diseased oligarchy with ease, replacing them with a new elite whose vigor and vision would surpass even the heroes of Britain’s millennia-long history. In order for that to happen, a more meaningful Brexit is necessary; not one from an institution, but a spiritual rejection of the forces of modernity. And despite the ban, the counter-forces of tradition still call from over the sea beyond the Pillars of Hercules: Arthur, awake!</p><div class="">
