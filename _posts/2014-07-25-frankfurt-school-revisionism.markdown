<p><em>Original Broadcast: February 16, 2012</em></p>

<p>Richard and Jonathan discuss the history of Critical Theory, the Frankfurt School, Cultural Marxism, and what has come to be known as Political Correctness. Cultural Marxism has often been deemed “revolution by other means,” but Richard and Jonathan emphasize the Frankfurt School reactionary, conservative, and elitist tendencies.</p>
