<p>A few years ago, I <a href="http://www.counter-currents.com/2014/03/the-american-dream-vs-the-american-nation/">wrote</a>: “If I tell you that there are powerful people who are oppressing you to defend their own interests, you’ll call me a progressive, a liberal, and a reformer. If I tell you who those people are, you’ll call me a Nazi.” </p>
<p>Turns out I was wrong. Those people will tell us who they are themselves.</p>
<p>Donald Trump, not willing to cringe before the utterly <a href="http://www.radixjournal.com/journal/2016/10/12/weaponized-morality">ludicrous</a> attempt to smear him with charges of sexual assault weeks before a presidential election, unleashed on the mainstream media in a speech last Thursday. </p>
<p>Accurately identifying <a href="http://www.vdare.com/kirkpatrick/for-hillary-and-the-gop-establishment-pc-really-means-plutocratic-control">political correctness as a tool of plutocratic control</a>, Trump thundered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The establishment and their media enablers will maintain control over this nation through means that are very well known. Anyone who challenges their control is deemed a sexist, a racist, a xenophobe, and morally deformed.</p>
<p>They will attack you, they will slander you, they will seek to destroy your career and your family, they will seek to destroy everything about you, including your reputation. They will lie, lie, lie, and then again they will do worse than that, they will do whatever is necessary. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those of us who must live under the <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/jared-taylor-the-splc-wants-to-starve-my-family-among-others">Eye of Sauron</a> on the Alt Right felt this deep within their bones. The goal of every <a href="http://www.counter-currents.com/2014/11/who-is-responsible-for-ferguson/">journalist</a> is to destroy you. They despise you, they want to hurt you, and the hateful malice they hold within themselves must be considered every time one of these creatures is encountered. None of the journalists now whining about being booed at a rally by the Americans they despise could handle what each one of us encounters every day. And the frothing, shrieking, hysterical malevolence Donald Trump has faced from the crawling chaos that is the press defies imagination.</p>
<p>Some say All Cops Are Bastards or that police are “political soldiers” enforcing a certain social order. Nonsense. <a href="http://www.counter-currents.com/2014/11/who-is-responsible-for-ferguson/">Journalists</a> are the political soldiers. More than that, they are commissars. Their job is to hunt down dissidents and suppress opposition. </p>
<p>As this election cycle has shown, they will fight fiercely to defend the power structure and lash out against alternatives which undermine the System they are a part of. A soldier or policeman bears far less moral responsibility for the policies he enforces than the journalist who knowingly works to implement those policies.  </p>
<p>At least in theory (<a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/trumpvscuckservatives">though rarely in practice in our post-Anglo society</a>), the law will protect you whatever your political views or wealth. But journalists always act with a political end in mind. </p>
<p>But whose end? In this critical speech, Trump identified that as well. After denying the accusations against him, he stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our great civilization, here in America and across the civilized world has come upon a moment of reckoning. We've seen it in the United Kingdom, where they voted to liberate themselves from global government and global trade deal, and global immigration deals that have destroyed their sovereignty and have destroyed many of those nations. But, the central base of world political power is right here in America, and it is our corrupt political establishment that is the greatest power behind the efforts at radical globalization and the disenfranchisement of working people. Their financial resources are virtually unlimited, their political resources are unlimited, their media resources are unmatched, and most importantly, the depths of their immorality is absolutely unlimited.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, Trump is identifying the globalists and international plutocrats who support open borders, the destruction of national sovereignty, the dispossession of working people, and the abolition of traditional identity and morality. They are deliberately harming the people of this country. And who can deny it?</p>
<p>Interestingly, no one really is. Instead, the media is accusing Trump of giving an “<a href="http://www.rawstory.com/2016/10/trump-just-gave-an-anti-semitic-speech-dripping-with-hatred-and-the-internet-is-horrified/">anti-Semitic speech dripping with hatred</a>.”</p>

<p>The words “Jew” or “Jewish” were never used in Trump’s speech. Instead, Trump was identifying the corrupt political class which he believes, accurately, has sold out the American people. Nor was this a “dog whistle.” As with most of Trump’s best speeches this election season, the speech in Florida bears the heavy influence of Stephen Miller, Jeff Sessions’s former senior policy advisor and one of the few civic nationalists on Capitol Hill. Despite being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn7rCt531RY">memed as the reincarnation of Joseph Goebbels</a>, he’s Jewish. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, as with the parentheses meme, Jewish reporters and media figures essentially outed themselves, announcing to the world that yes, they are behind globalism, outsourcing, mass immigration, and the deliberate destruction of the country. Furthermore, while they can identify themselves in this way, it is inherently anti-Semitic for others to do so. And certain provable facts, like Hillary Clinton explicitly praising open borders in private speeches to international banks, are ipso facto banned from discussion. </p>
<p>Trump essentially said there is a small group of people who are deliberately destroying our country for their own gain. And many Jews screamed, “Hey, you can’t say that, because you’re referring to us and what we are doing.” I don’t think Trump is the “anti-Semitic” one in this equation. </p>
<p>What about Mr. Miller? The important thing to remember about Stephen Miller is that his attitudes should be typical of all Americans in government. This includes Jews if we really are supposed to believe they’re just like everyone else. </p>
<p>It shouldn’t be controversial that our government tries to protect our own national interest, guard our sovereignty, and ensure the continued existence of our people. It shouldn’t even be up for debate. Even considering other ends for government is essentially proof of treason. “America First” shouldn’t be provocative, but obvious.   </p>
<p>It’s good that Miller doesn’t hate the United States. But it’s perverted that this is seen as a notable exception, rather than something Americans have the right to expect and demand. One Stephen Miller doesn’t change the reality that just about every other Jewish journalist, political figure, and media organization (on both “Left” and “Right”) has been brought to the point of frothing madness simply because a presidential candidate believes his own country should be put first. </p>
<p>A System defined by hypocrisy can only function if the iron fist of oppression is concealed behind the velvet glove of multicultural happy talk. And the lying press is being forced to reveal the true nature of the System which rules us and who it benefits. The astonishingly crude hatred directed against European-Americans is daily made more explicit. </p>
<p>Who, after all, can take this artificial, top-down driven campaign against Trump seriously? We have (((Bill Mahrer,))) whose entire career has been defined by crude boasts about his sexual immorality, earnestly furrowing his brow and <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/bill-maher-can-you-be-a-good-person-and-vote-for-trump/">asking</a> if Republicans can be good “human beings” because they support Trump. We have the same American Left which endlessly crusaded against the Iraq War and who told us “dissent is patriotic” <a href="http://www.towleroad.com/2016/09/keith-olbermann-trump-3/">accusing</a> the Republican nominee and his supporters of being agents of a foreign government. We now have proof Hillary Clinton is essentially the <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-15/here-are-hillary-clintons-three-speeches-goldman-sachs-which-she-was-paid-675000">willing puppet</a>  of Wall Street bankers in a way that defies caricature, and yet we have the President of the United States <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2016/10/14/obama-change-wild-west-media/">worrying the corporate media doesn’t have enough control over the public debate</a>. <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/claremonts-codevilla-on-the-coming-revolution-americans-will-be-nostalgic-for-donald-trumps-moderation">The ruling class is revealing itself <em>as</em> a ruling class</a> which offers us nothing but hatred. And rather than at least offering us a compromise, they’re just demanding we submit and die quietly.    </p>
<p>And of course, there are those who are urging us to do just that. Preposterous cuck David French <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/441089/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-american-republic-faces-bigger-threats">moans</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the Pew Foundation has amply documented, Americans are polarized in the worst possible way — two tribes not so much united by love for their own as hatred for the other. </p>
<p>America is strong enough to withstand bad policy, but no nation can long endure public panic. The stakes in 2016 are not high enough to burn anything down, nor to sacrifice any element of your character or moral convictions. </p>
<p>Take a deep breath, America. We should be better than this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What do you mean <em>we</em>, you <a href="http://www.radixjournal.com/blog/2016/6/2/french-kissof-death">ridiculous traitor</a>? The American nation-state has been successfully deconstructed and politics today is a zero-sum game of identity politics, not a genteel debate over policy. Contra Hillary’s slogan of “Stronger Together,” every day brings more proof that European-Americans are suffering under the yoke of this poisonous occupying government which regards us as an enemy to be destroyed. </p>
<p>And what twisted version of morality celebrates remaining submissive to criminals? The scribblings of French and other nauseating collaborators is a desperate attempt to keep our people enslaved. Stupidity and cowardice are the most charitable explanations for such conduct. </p>
<p>It’s not that Donald Trump is a “White nationalist,” a fascist, or even particularly right wing. As a civic nationalist, a supporter of affirmative action, and a passionate Zionist, Trump should be well within the mainstream of Weimerican politics. And yet, he and his supporters are being attacked as existential threats to the Republic. </p>
<p>This tells us the System can only tolerate our continued existence when we are utterly degraded and on our knees, that we are only to be permitted to exist when the purpose of our very lives is to fuel a System pursuing our genocide. And the most privileged members of this system, rather than shrinking back, are comfortable telling us exactly who they are and what they are doing. </p>
