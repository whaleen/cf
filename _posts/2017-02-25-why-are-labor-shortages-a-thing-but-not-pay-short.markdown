<blockquote><p><a id="xlink_1_2" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/#xlink_1_2" name="xlink_1_2"></a> You got it, <a href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/david-brooks-responds-to-my-undocumented-irrigation-with-his-own-watery-metaphors/#comment-1777378">Buffalo Joe.</a> My native disposition isn’t all that strongly “pro-laborist”, but I’m just astounded by the twaddle written about labor. I was in a hiring capacity, and the #1 reason we could not keep talented people was we could not pay them well. It’s no better than half-truth to say we were having “labor shortages”. The workers who left us were having “pay shortages”—they brought strong skills to the table, and we weren’t paying them enough for those skills.</p></blockquote>
