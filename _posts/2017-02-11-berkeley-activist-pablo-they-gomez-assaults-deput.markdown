&lt;p&gt;FEBRUARY 1, 2017&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pablo Gomez, 22, is charged with first-degree murder in the fatal Jan. 6 stabbing of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vdare.com/posts/was-theys-murder-of-a-berkeley-schoolteacher-a-hate-crime&quot;&gt;27-year-old Emilie Inman&lt;/a&gt; at her home on Ashby Avenue. …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of Gomez’s family, friends from the UC Berkeley community and Inman’s Ashby Avenue housemates were in court for the 9 a.m. arraignment. The spectators were present when Gomez, wearing a red jail jumpsuit, met with a public defender, George Arroyo, in a small room adjoining the courtroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arroyo emerged from the meeting after a few minutes as the sound of banging and screaming came from the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He is losing it,” Arroyo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4&quot; class=&quot;vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539&quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well of course they is. You called them “he” rather than&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vdare.com/posts/pablo-gomez-jr-is-suspected-of-homicide-but-they-deserve-to-be-known-by-the-gender-pronoun-they-prefer&quot;&gt; they’s preferred pronoun “they.”&lt;/a&gt; What kind of Bay Area lawyer are you not to first ask about pronouns?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sheriff’s deputy rushed to the room, and shouts of “Get off me!” could be heard in the courtroom. Two more deputies responded and wrestled the 5-foot-5-inch, 110-pound Gomez to the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gomez, who is being held without bail at Alameda County’s Santa Rita Jail, was dragged from the courtroom as family and friends wept. One of the deputies had what appeared to be a deep scratch on one hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
