<div class="pf-content"><p>Western elites, or some major subset of them, are in thrall to what can fairly be called the <em>meteorological</em> theory of mass Third World immigration.  It&#8217;s like the weather — nothing you can do!</p>
<blockquote><p>As many as four million men from Afghanistan could travel to Britain and other European nations along migrant routes if the West abandons the war-ravaged country, the Defence Secretary has warned.</p>
<p>Sir Michael Fallon admitted the UK and Nato cannot pull troops out of Afghanistan because the terrorist groups that existed there when soldiers deployed in 2001 remain and &#8220;still pose a threat.&#8221;</p><!-- TAG START { player: "7518-804336-VDare - Outstream - Rev", owner: "ONE Video by AOL", for: "ONE Video by AOL" - BEINJS } --><div id="57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4" class="vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539">    <script type="text/javascript" src="//delivery.vidible.tv/jsonp/pid=57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4/56bcd17ce4b018167fea5539_bein.js"></script></div><!-- TAG END { date: 07/25/16 } -->
<p>As the Ministry of Defence considers sending more troops to the country, Sir Michael warned that if Afghanistan collapses, Europe &#8220;will feel the consequences, very directly.&#8221; [<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4240580/4m-flee-Afghanistan-Britain-pulls-country.html"><em>Four million people could flee to Europe if Britain pulls out of Afghanistan, warns defence minister</em></a> by Larisa Brown, Defence Correspondent; Daily Mail, February 19th 2017.]</p></blockquote>
<p>Britain is an island nation, for crying out loud.  How difficult is it to just <em>keep people out?</em></p>
<p>Perhaps the Brits should hire in some consultants from Japan.</p>
