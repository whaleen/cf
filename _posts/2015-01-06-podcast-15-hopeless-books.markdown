Alternative Right co-editor and author Andy Nowicki is joined by Takimag editor and author Ann Sterzinger to discuss the joys and perils of independent publishing and free inquiry in an age of rampant illiteracy and crushing conformity. Ann and Andy talk about Ann's latest venture, Hopeless Books, where the second edition of Andy's book THE DOCTOR AND THE HERETIC has been published.
