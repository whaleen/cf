With Andy "missing in action" due to the rigours of Thanksgiving, Colin is joined by the legendary Matt Forney and Daniel Spaulding, a contributor to Alternative Right and The Soul of the East, to discuss – and dispense 'fortune cookie' wisdom on – "The Asian Question." Will the 21st century be the Asian (or Chinese) century? Other topics include Confucian values, Asian intelligence and conformity, and demographic trends.

After spending several months in the Philippines this summer, Matt joins us from New York, while Daniel calls in from a particularly noisy Dunkin Donuts in downtown Seoul (apologies for occasional background rumblings).<div class="">
