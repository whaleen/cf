Andy chats with author Ann Sterzinger, the reigning Alt-Right "It Girl." Topics include Ann's recent experiences as ex-editrix of Takimag and Trigger Warning. her soon-to-be-completed magnum opus LYFE, a futuristic comedy of a world (and moon) gone wrong, and the strangely hypnotic appeal of reading dystoptic fiction,.i.e. books detailing perfectly awful future societies. Raggedy Ann and Andy also broach the topic of Rachel Haywire and the Alt-Right proclivity to taste Jews in one's sandwich.<div class="">
