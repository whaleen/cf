President Trump returned in triumph to CPAC this afternoon. As some of you might recall, he wasn&#8217;t so fondly received by the #TruCons at CPAC 2016, but after his amazing landslide victory in the 2016 election he has triumphed over these cucks. Note: Who knows? Maybe President Richard Spencer will address CPAC one day.<div class="">
