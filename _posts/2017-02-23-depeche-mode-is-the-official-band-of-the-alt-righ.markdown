@JefferyXMartin I was joking obviously. I&#39;m a lifelong Depeche Mode fan. &#8212; Richard ðŸ¥› Spencer (@RichardBSpencer) February 23, 2017 I&#8217;m also eating some Wendy&#8217;s while wearing New Balance shoes. Seriously though, we have the power to troll the media for the lulz and they will run off now and breathlessly report on a joke. We&#8217;ve done it with everything from haircuts to fast food to tennis shoes and now to bands. The joke is that the &#8220;free press&#8221; is fake news!<div class="">
