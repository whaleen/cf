This Week in Hate<br />

<p>Valerie Grim discovered flyers from a white nationalist group posted outside her office at Indiana University in Bloomington.</p>

<p>Growing up in Mississippi in the 1960s, Prof. Valerie Grim was only too familiar with racism. So when she discovered flyers from a white nationalist group posted outside her office at Indiana University Bloomington, she wasn’t intimidated.</p><!-- TAG START { player: "7518-804336-VDare - Outstream - Rev", owner: "ONE Video by AOL", for: "ONE Video by AOL" - BEINJS } --><div id="57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4" class="vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539">    <script type="text/javascript" src="//delivery.vidible.tv/jsonp/pid=57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4/56bcd17ce4b018167fea5539_bein.js"></script></div><!-- TAG END { date: 07/25/16 } -->
<p>Instead, she was curious about what had led someone to post flyers depicting Michelangelo’s David along with the phrase “Let’s become great again” and the name of Identity Evropa, a white nationalist group, outside offices in the university’s department of African-American and African diaspora studies. The group’s name, symbol and Twitter handle were also written on the whiteboard on Prof. Grim’s door.</p>
<p>“This is someone who really got a wrong view of history,” says Professor Grim, who teaches African-American history.</p></blockquote>

<p>The NYT’s <em>This Week in Hate</em> column has still not deigned to cover the beatings of dissidents in Berkeley by masked blackshirts.</p>
<p>But the distribution of flyers featuring the greatest work of art by a single artist demands massive coverage.</p>
<p>The city of Florence should dress David from head to toe in black, including a mask, so he would stop being such a Symbol of Hate.</p>
