   &lt;div class=&quot;pf-content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, Mexico had smiled pleasantly as it ripped America off for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2016-02-02/mexico-remittances-nearly-248b-in-2015-topping-oil-income&quot;&gt;billions of dollars in remittances&lt;/a&gt;, highly expensive &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vdare.com/posts/million-dollar-mexican-medical-moocher&quot;&gt;US-taxpayer-funded healthcare&lt;/a&gt; and other freebies, even while pretending to be a friend and good neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s getting harding for Mexes to maintain appearances when the new sheriff in Washington DC has told them that the US no longer accepts to their duplicity: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/25/as-trump-targets-immigration-2-million-criminal-noncitizens-already-inside-u-s.html&quot;&gt;criminals are being sent home&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/02/11/trump-denies-increased-border-wall-cost-promises-price-will-come-way-down/&quot;&gt;sturdy wall will be built&lt;/a&gt; to keep invaders out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfriendly Mexico has chosen to fight back. It announced the other day that it would aid its lawbreaking citizens by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/02/11/influential-mexicans-urge-illegals-in-u-s-targeted-for-deportation-jam-the-courts-to-fight-trump/&quot;&gt;jamming American courts with illegal immigration cases&lt;/a&gt;. The Mexican government has allocated $50 million to help its US-residing illegals fight deportation in court and has instructed its 50 (!) consulates to provide assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, nobody in the media finds it odd that Mexico prefers that its citizens reside outside their own country. Where’s the love, Presidente Peña Nieto?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4&quot; class=&quot;vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539&quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mexican invaders themselves apparently find jail in the US to be preferable to freedom in Mexico, as long as they believe they will prevail eventually. Funny how the illegals regard America as their territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Illegal immigrants meet with Mexican officials in Phoenix, discuss options under Trump administration&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHOENIX—All but one of about 50 undocumented Mexican migrants at a meeting Saturday indicated they would rather risk detention and long court battles in the U.S. than return to Mexico voluntarily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of migrants at the meeting in Phoenix, which included Mexican officials, signaled in a show of hands that they were ready to fight deportation in U.S. courts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Even if that means detention for weeks?” asked former foreign minister Jorge Castaneda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Even if it takes months,” shouted one woman. “Even if it takes years,” another yelled. “We are here to fight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Castaneda and others want Mexico’s government to endorse a tough and perhaps risky strategy to battle an expected increase in deportations of their undocumented compatriots in the U.S. by underwriting the migrants’ legal struggle in the U.S. court system. By overwhelming already heavily burdened immigration courts, Mr. Castaneda hopes the legal system would break down, bringing deportations to a halt. . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
