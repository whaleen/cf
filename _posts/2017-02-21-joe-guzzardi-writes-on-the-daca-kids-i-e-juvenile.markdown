<p><strong>From: Joe Guzzardi [<a href="mailto:joeguzzardi@capsweb.org">Email him</a>]</strong></p>
<p>My friend of long-standing<a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/national-data-deal-with-daca-with-heart-what-about-american-millennials"> Ed Rubenstein</a> wrote a fantastic column about “squishy” Donald Trump who’s gone all wobbly on DACA. A cowardly Trump has repeatedly and embarrassingly <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/02/16/trump-says-wants-to-deal-with-daca-recipients-with-heart.html">called the DACA’s </a>“exceptional kids,” an overstatement of great proportions.</p>
<p>The large percentage of those allegedly outstanding kids, if previously employed, probably committed identity fraud, a felony. Gone mostly unnoticed in the recent DACA brouhaha is that in 2012 under Obama’s Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, face-to-face interviews were never conducted, approval rates ran about 99 percent, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services required applicants to list only Social Security numbers that the Social Security Administration officially issued.</p><!-- TAG START { player: "7518-804336-VDare - Outstream - Rev", owner: "ONE Video by AOL", for: "ONE Video by AOL" - BEINJS } --><div id="57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4" class="vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539">    <script type="text/javascript" src="//delivery.vidible.tv/jsonp/pid=57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4/56bcd17ce4b018167fea5539_bein.js"></script></div><!-- TAG END { date: 07/25/16 } -->

Furthermore, although the application asked about gang affiliations, when the Center for Immigration Studies submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to learn the results, it was told that: &#8220;The information you seek is not a field that is electronically captured,” a big time cover up.[<a href="http://cis.org/north/are-daca-aliens-gang-members-uscis-does-not-want-know">Are DACA Aliens Gang Members?

<p>When in-person interviews aren’t required, stolen identities winked at, and gang membership ignored, the strong probability is that many not-so-incredible kids received DACA work authorization permits.</p>
