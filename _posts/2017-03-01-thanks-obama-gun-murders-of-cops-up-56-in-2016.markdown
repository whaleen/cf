<p><a id="xlink_1_4" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/thanks-obama-gun-murders-of-cops-up-56-in-2016/#xlink_1_4" name="xlink_1_4"></a>The 135 officer fatalities in 2016 is a 10 percent increase over the 123 who died in the line of duty last year and is the highest total since 2011, when 177 officers made the ultimate sacrifice.</p>
<p><a id="xlink_1_5" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/thanks-obama-gun-murders-of-cops-up-56-in-2016/#xlink_1_5" name="xlink_1_5"></a>Firearms-related incidents were the number one cause of death in 2016, with 64 officers shot and killed across the country. This represents a significant spike—56 percent—over the 41 officers killed by gunfire in 2015.</p>
<p><a id="xlink_1_6" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/thanks-obama-gun-murders-of-cops-up-56-in-2016/#xlink_1_6" name="xlink_1_6"></a>Of the 64 shooting deaths of officers this year, 21 were the result of ambush style attacks—the highest total in more than two decades. Eight multiple shooting death incidents claimed the lives of 20 officers in 2016, tied with 1971 for the highest total of any year since 1932.</p></blockquote>
<p><a id="xlink_1_7" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/thanks-obama-gun-murders-of-cops-up-56-in-2016/#xlink_1_7" name="xlink_1_7"></a>It’s almost as if Obama made it so that his last year in office resembled his mentor Bill Ayers’ heyday.</p>
<blockquote><p>Those incidents included five officers killed in ambush attacks in Dallas (TX) and three in Baton Rouge (LA), spanning 10 days in July.</p></blockquote>
<p><a id="xlink_1_9" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/thanks-obama-gun-murders-of-cops-up-56-in-2016/#xlink_1_9" name="xlink_1_9"></a>Those terrorist attacks, and several other shootings by blacks of whites, had immediately followed Obama’s social media driven denunciation of America’s racist system of justice. From the <em>New York Times</em> on <a title="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/09/us/politics/obama-balance-race-police-dallas-shooting.html?_r=0" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/09/us/politics/obama-balance-race-police-dallas-shooting.html?_r=0">July 8, 2016</a>:</p>

Given what had happened, he told his aides, he didn’t think it was enough. …</p><div id="57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4" class="vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539">    </div>

<p><a id="xlink_1_12" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/thanks-obama-gun-murders-of-cops-up-56-in-2016/#xlink_1_12" name="xlink_1_12"></a>… As someone who knows well the persuasive power of speech, Mr. Obama has sought to use the authority of his office to amplify and support the emerging Black Lives Matter movement while striving not to become an unwitting megaphone for anti-police sentiment that has at times fueled violent protests and police shootings.</p>
<p><a id="xlink_1_13" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/thanks-obama-gun-murders-of-cops-up-56-in-2016/#xlink_1_13" name="xlink_1_13"></a>… Four hours into the flight to his first stop, Warsaw, the president stopped his press secretary, Josh Earnest, in a plane corridor.</p>
