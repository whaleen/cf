With last-minute attempts being made to keep Greece in the Euro and China facing a serious stock market crash, Colin Liddell is joined by Alt-Right's own man in the Philippines, Siryako Akda, to discuss the turbulent state of the global economy. Issues raised include the rise and limits of the EU's "invisble empire," the "liquidity killing" tendencies of parsimonious Orientals, and whether global capitalism has finally run out of road. Is the World getting ready for an autarkic Winter, and if so will liberal leftism be the first luxury chucked overboard?<div class="">
