<p>Ah, the late 90s. Rosie O’Donnell was “<a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CnbbcHBXgAAB5Bs.jpg">the queen of nice</a>.” Ellen Degeneres was controversial, rather than the comforting television friend of housewives who want to watch Hillary Clinton awkwardly dancing to hip-hop. And Keith Olbermann was the guy from the Boston Market commercials, making fun of self-important, fashion-conscious poseurs by telling them to “eat something!”   </p>
<p>Now, the failed sportscaster who used to rhapsodize about the joys of “four ooey-gooey cheeses” has proclaimed himself the head of “The Resistance,” striking what is presumably <a href="https://twitter.com/JBurtonXP/status/808774462992687104">meant to be a defiant pose</a> wrapped in an American flag. Unfortunately, he looks more like a homeless man covering himself while he self-abuses and leers at passersby. </p>
<p>His facial expression is also hard to interpret. He’s vaguely angry but also ironically smirking, as if he knows he’s self-consciously posing as something he’s not. His shade from the 90s would doubtless bring him some mac n’ cheese so this troubled soul can “eat something!” and experience some succor. </p>
<p>Olbermann, who can boast of being replaced on Current TV by Eliot Spitzer, was given an Internet show by GQ. GQ also features the semi-literate screeching of Lindy West, the unearthly monstrosity whose presence on this planet, let alone at a men’s magazine, suggests a grotesque mockery of existence itself. After all, what sophisticated, masculine gentleman can’t conquer the boardrooms and boudoirs of America without having his worldview shaped by Olbermann and West?</p>
<p>Initially called “The Closer,” Olbermann renamed the show “The Resistance” after The Fall of Hillary. He stares angrily at the camera and gives what he imagines are revolutionary manifestos. The logo for the show also features the safety pin – or diaper pin – liberals have adopted as their logo. Thus, it’s a “resistance” movement, which won’t accept the rule of Trump, but it’s also a movement designed to make you feel safe and good and not make you do anything. For example, his big idea to delegitimize the Trump regime is the <a href="http://ijr.com/wildfire/2016/12/761684-keith-olbermanns-meltdown-over-trumps-election-continues-urges-people-humiliate-him-everyday/">womanish, passive-aggressive tactic</a> of not calling him president.</p>
<p>Yet this Kabuki theater is still interesting for what it tells about the Left today. And this kind of rhetoric has consequences even for the faux resistance fighters of Generation Tumblr.</p>
<p>Consider an unhinged <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFxPXGDH4E">performance</a> where Olbermann grandly proclaims the Russians have performed a bloodless coup, “so far.” Thus, America is no longer a sovereign nation or a free people. (Of course, that part is true, but it has nothing to do with Russians.)</p>
<p>Olbermann casually tosses around words like “traitorous” and makes ludicrous comparisons to “Pearl Harbor.” Eventually, this ridiculous hysteric in an ill-fitting suit, who can’t even drive a car because of an “equilibrium problem,” urges “desperate measures” be taken. Otherwise, power will fall into the hands of “scum!” </p>
<p>Or as he puts it, “Russian scum!”</p>
<p>Assuming <em>arguendo</em> Olbermann still has what can be called a career, consider how quickly it would end if he applied this descriptor to a different nationality. </p>
<p>The government of Mexico quite openly <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/memo-from-middle-america-post-election-mexico-steps-up-meddling-but-trump-can-tromp-on-them">meddles</a> in American affairs through a vast consular network, encourages its nationals to become <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/said-in-spanish-meddling-mexico-promotes-drive-to-help-mexican-immigrants-become-u-s-citizens-and-voters-etc">American citizens to defend Mexican interests</a>, and proudly 
proclaimed its determination to <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/memo-from-middle-america-main-stream-media-finally-notices-meddling-mexicans-encouraging-immigrants-to-naturalize-and-vote-against-trump-but-where-is-gop">interfere</a> in the recent election. Can we denounce “Mexican scum?” After all, we don’t have to look very hard to find actual evidence of their attacks on American sovereignty. And it’s a lot easier to show Mexico, rather than Russia, has designs on American sovereignty and territory. </p>
<p>What about “Arab scum” or “Muslim scum,” like the Saudi royals who have close ties with American officials, routinely violate Western laws, and purchase influence in American media organizations? </p>
<p>Or “Israeli” or “Jewish scum?” The Israeli government isn’t exactly shy about its espionage activities, nor about its close relationships to American politicians and pressure groups. </p>
<p>Nothing like this would ever happen. Only a White nation can be casually denounced as “scum” and an <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/ethnic-hatred-of-russians-celebrated-in-american-media">entire people dehumanized in the most extreme terms</a>. And we don’t even need to address the absurdity of self-styled citizens of the world suddenly caring about concepts such as national independence or sovereignty. </p>
<p>“If we did it to another country, it would be described as an act of war!” continued Olbermann. Well, much of the history of Eastern Europe and the Middle East since the end of the Cold War has been precisely that, including many of the stupid color-coded revolutions designed to break down resistance to the Borg of international finance. If there is in fact a war, it’s one the United States, or, rather, those who control American foreign policy, deliberately started. </p>
<p>Indeed, the dominant theme of Vladimir Putin’s domestic and foreign policy is the desire to counter the State Department/Soros playbook of regime change. Banning NGO’s dependent on foreign money, organizing youth groups designed to co-opt opposition, and funding ‘independent’ groups such as the Night Wolves MC, which can be counted on as loyal auxiliaries, are all part of this effort. Both Assad and Putin are defending their legitimate governments from subversive movements funded by the United States. Considering the gruesome fate of Gaddafi, can anyone blame them? </p>
<p>But leave aside the ridiculous spectacle of Keith Olbermann, of all people, LARPing for a redux of <a href="http://www.counter-currents.com/2012/12/red-dawn-1984/">Red Dawn</a>. He clearly wants to bring the war home. Kellyanne Conway is a “<a href="http://dailycaller.com/2016/11/21/keith-olbermann-kellyanne-conway-is-a-wretched-human-and-a-fascist-video/">fascist</a>.” Trump has “<a href="http://www.radixjournal.com/journal/2016/12/13/illegitimate">no authority</a>.” Republicans are “traitors.” </p>
<p>Ok… therefore, what? Do you start shooting people? Announce the dissolution of the Union? California is practically already in a state of rebellion <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/22/politics/california-immigration-donald-trump/">when it comes to immigration laws</a>. Olbermann supposedly once dated <a href="http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/the_slatest/2016/07/21/laura_ingraham_s_nazi_salute_examined/ingrahamsalute.jpg.CROP.promovar-mediumlarge.jpg">Trump supporter Laura Ingraham.</a> Should he attack his ex-girlfriend? The punishment for treason is pretty clear, after all. </p>
<p>Absurd scenarios all. Olbermann is a poseur as surely as the fashion models he used to mock in his sandwich salesman days. But it’s likely someone will act on this rhetoric. People are already <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH8ylXIjKec">being murdered because of incitement about “white privilege” and Black Lives Matter</a>. </p>
<p>And nothing he says is “extreme.” Years ago, Olbermann was a target for parody even by the likes of <a href="http://www.cc.com/video-clips/wegwzd/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-special-comment---keith-olbermann-s-name-calling">Jon Stewart</a> or <a href="http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/countdown-with-keith-olbermann/n12348?snl=1">Saturday Night Live</a>. But today, there’s nothing he says which is any different from what comes out of <em>The New York Times</em>, or Slate, or the Democratic Party. </p>
<p>If Donald Trump had lost the election and refused to accept the result, he could not be doing more to undermine American institutions than the mainstream Left is today. Conservatives are cheap dates. All Hillary would have had to say is “let’s work together” and the Beltway Right would have caved entirely. Even if Trump had openly said not to accept Hillary as President, no other Republicans or mainstream conservative media outlets would have joined him. </p>
<p>But leftists, with the vast institutional advantages they enjoy in huge foundations, organizations like the National Lawyers Guild providing support, and the mainstream media providing air cover and protecting activists from negative PR, are always ready to kick off street action. Already, we see the borderline gleeful reaction from Antifa and Far-Left groups who are going to LARP that they are fighting a real “fascist” regime. And organizations on the Far-Left are growing almost as quickly as the Alt-Right. </p>
<p>Sadly, we don’t have a revolutionary regime in power. What we have is a civic nationalist in alliance with clueless Republicans like Paul Ryan who see the present moment as just another opportunity to screw over their supporters by slashing Medicare. </p>
<p>But events may overtake everyone, even the Far-Left. <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/if-only-the-god-emperor-knew-using-trumpism-against-the-trump-administration">Memeing Trump into a “Far-Right” God-Emperor</a> is a two way process. The likes of Olbermann and the tens of millions of other leftists who think they are going to live out Rogue One or Harry Potter are playing with forces they do not understand and starting a process they will not be able to control. Throwing around words like ‘rebellion’ and ‘fascism’ to hysterical cucked Whites and furiously hostile non-Whites is asking for an explosion. </p>
<p>As long as the Trump Administration doesn’t completely cave on immigration policies (unlikely if Jeff Sessions gets in), there will be at least some confrontations between federal forces and emboldened leftists or angry minorities. What happens when someone takes a shot at DHS officers arresting deportees? When we see a new outbreak of terrorism after President Trump approves more pipelines? When Attorney General Sessions drops the hammer on the next Ferguson riot?</p>
<p>Ultimately, even the most extreme leftist Antifa is dependent on the normal suburban Whites they hate accepting <a href="http://www.npiamerica.org/the-national-policy-institute/category/the-dobermans-of-political-correctness">the moral frame created by mainstream media gaslighting</a>. In theory, philosophical conservatism admits the flawed nature of man, that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Igooxb4D1c">he must be governed</a>. In practice, nice, normal, conservative goofballs want to believe everyone is basically good and that all “Americans,” whatever their race, are all in this together. The best thing which can happen is for Normie America to be forced to witness how this is simply not true. </p>
<p>During the primaries, we saw how every <a href="https://www.amren.com/news/2016/05/the-truth-in-the-streets/">protest</a> led to <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/trumps-strategy-confront-main-stream-media-its-working">increased support</a> for Trump with Republicans rallying to the “strong man” when there is chaos in the streets. And unlike George W. Bush, Trump fires back at his <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/735465352436408320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">opponents</a>, rather than apologizing. We’ve already got supposedly mainstream figures appearing at events <a href="https://refusefascism.org/an-emergency-organizing-meeting/">organized by the Revolutionary Communist Party</a> and being livestreamed by the Huffington Post. The stage is all set for the Left to kick off the revolution for us. And on our side, we at least have the beginnings of a movement which won’t cuck and run. </p>
<p>The first test is weeks away. If the Inauguration is a peaceful celebration, Trump is legitimate and “normalized.” If it turns into a melee, the ride is just getting started.</p>
<p>SJW’s always project. We’re always told about how conservatism and nationalism is built on “paranoia” and “fear” by the same people currently screeching Literally Hitler will be President of the United States. When their entire political movement is built upon whipping up hysteria, eventually someone is going to take it seriously. Feeding these lunatics revolutionary fantasies is dangerous. </p>
<p>Of course, I doubt Keith Olbermann and those like him actually want to start a “rebellion.” I question <a href="http://img07.deviantart.net/c9ad/i/2014/137/e/d/if_modern_anarchists_fought_in_spain__part_1__by_rednblacksalamander-d7irpe5.jpg">even the most “militant” leftists of today</a>. These subsidized puffballs wouldn’t last five minutes, and at some level they know it. But there’s now a significant chance their more excitable followers are going to start taking certain actions they won’t be able to retract. And once something like this is set in motion, it only ends one way. </p>
<p>At the end of each of Olbermann’s segments, he declares: “Resist!  Peace.” Well, which is it? We’ll soon find out. </p><div class="">
