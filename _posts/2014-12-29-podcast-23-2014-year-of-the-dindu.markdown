2014 was the year of the non-story posing as the real story and the real story posing as the non-story. While America's SJW-driven media pushed hollow narratives of police brutality against "dindu nuffins" and "rape culture," the Ukraine saw a proxy war breaking out between Russia and America, with both parties claiming they too "dindu nuffin." Andy and Colin are joined by fellow "gentle giants" Richard Spencer of Radix Journal & NPI and Michael Enoch of the The Right Stuff & The Daily Shoah to unpick the year and possibly "turn their lives around."<div class="">
