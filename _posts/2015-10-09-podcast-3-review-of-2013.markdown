Andy and Colin are joined by Carl, "the mysterious Swede," to take a look back at the Year of the Snake as it starts to slither out of sight. Among the talking points are MSNBC's attack on NPI and Alternative Right, the steady growth of Euro-nationalism, the ritualistic suicide of Dominique Venner, the superpower showdown over Syria, the rise of Bitcoin, the successful NPI Conference in Washington, the death of Margaret Thatcher, and, of course, Miley Cyrus's over-active tongue.
