&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stephen K. Bannon referred to the Italian philosopher Julius Evola in a Vatican speech in 2014. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ROME — Those trying to divine the roots of Stephen K. Bannon’s dark and at times apocalyptic worldview have repeatedly combed over a speech that Mr. Bannon, President Trump’s ideological guru, made in 2014 to a Vatican conference, where he expounded on Islam, populism and capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4&quot; class=&quot;vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539&quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for all the examination of those remarks, a passing reference by Mr. Bannon to an esoteric Italian philosopher has gone little noticed, except perhaps by scholars and followers of the deeply taboo, Nazi-affiliated thinker, Julius Evola.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many, many words on who Ebola was ensue, followed, finally, by this on what exactly Bannon said about him:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;… he mentioned “Julius Evola and different writers of the early 20th century who are really the supporters of what’s called the Traditionalist movement, which really eventually metastasized into Italian Fascism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You pretty much have to assume Bannon is pro-cancer to think his use of the word “metastasized” constitutes an endorsement, but I imagine a lot of people imagine Bannon is pro-cancer after all the hate propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;
