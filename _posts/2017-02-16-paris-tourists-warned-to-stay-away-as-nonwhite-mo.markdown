A spokesman for Seoul’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: “These South Korean tourists had taken a bus after a visit to the Eiffel Tower and were on their way to Saint-Denis, the location of their hotel. “Individuals suddenly boarded the coach and snatched the tourists’ Eurostar tickets, which were being kept by the tour guide, whose passport was also taken.” Read the rest at The New Observer.           # => "I’ve been hurting to write this ever since we had the idea of creating a Planet for Cubox..."
