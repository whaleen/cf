<div class="pf-content"><p>The Main Stream Media reports that a DREAMER was arrested at his father&#8217;s home last week. His father is a Mexican, convicted felon who returned to the US. ICE agents went to the house to arrest the father.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>ICE says Daniel Ramirez is a gang member — which could make for a tricky case</strong></p>
<p id="oamQ8g">On Tuesday, ICE released a statement calling Daniel Ramirez a “self-admitted gang member” who’d been taken into custody “based on his admitted gang affiliation and risk to public safety.”</p>
<p id="ivFTuX">Ramirez’s lawyers deny that he has any gang involvement — instead, lawyer Ethan Dettmer <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-immigration-arrest-exclusiv-idUSKBN15T307">told Reuters</a> that ICE agents “repeatedly pressured” Ramirez “to falsely admit” gang affiliation. Dettmer, it’s worth noting, is a partner at the major law firm Gibson Dunn &amp; Crutcher, whose partners include former US Solicitor General Ted Olson and a lawyer who was rumored to be on the shortlist to head the Securities and Exchange Commission under Trump — which should give you a sense of how seriously advocates are taking this case.</p><!-- TAG START { player: "7518-804336-VDare - Outstream - Rev", owner: "ONE Video by AOL", for: "ONE Video by AOL" - BEINJS } --><div id="57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4" class="vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539">    <script type="text/javascript" src="//delivery.vidible.tv/jsonp/pid=57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4/56bcd17ce4b018167fea5539_bein.js"></script></div><!-- TAG END { date: 07/25/16 } -->

<p><em>Is Ramirez&#8217;s arrest a mistake, or an omen? 750,000 immigrants’ lives depend on the answer.</em></p>

<p>This article states that David Ramirez Medina&#8217;s brother was also in the house. He is a Dreamer but he wasn&#8217;t arrested. Why did this brother get different treatment? Perhaps one brother confessed to gang affiliation and the other did not. That would support the ICE position in the matter.</p>
<p>The hearing is scheduled for Friday but there may be action today on the matter. This will be one to watch.</p>
