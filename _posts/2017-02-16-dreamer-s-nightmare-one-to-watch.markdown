   &lt;div class=&quot;pf-content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Main Stream Media reports that a DREAMER was arrested at his father’s home last week. His father is a Mexican, convicted felon who returned to the US. ICE agents went to the house to arrest the father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ICE says Daniel Ramirez is a gang member — which could make for a tricky case&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;oamQ8g&quot;&gt;On Tuesday, ICE released a statement calling Daniel Ramirez a “self-admitted gang member” who’d been taken into custody “based on his admitted gang affiliation and risk to public safety.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ivFTuX&quot;&gt;Ramirez’s lawyers deny that he has any gang involvement — instead, lawyer Ethan Dettmer &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-immigration-arrest-exclusiv-idUSKBN15T307&quot;&gt;told Reuters&lt;/a&gt; that ICE agents “repeatedly pressured” Ramirez “to falsely admit” gang affiliation. Dettmer, it’s worth noting, is a partner at the major law firm Gibson Dunn &amp;amp; Crutcher, whose partners include former US Solicitor General Ted Olson and a lawyer who was rumored to be on the shortlist to head the Securities and Exchange Commission under Trump — which should give you a sense of how seriously advocates are taking this case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4&quot; class=&quot;vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539&quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is Ramirez’s arrest a mistake, or an omen? 750,000 immigrants’ lives depend on the answer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article states that David Ramirez Medina’s brother was also in the house. He is a Dreamer but he wasn’t arrested. Why did this brother get different treatment? Perhaps one brother confessed to gang affiliation and the other did not. That would support the ICE position in the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hearing is scheduled for Friday but there may be action today on the matter. This will be one to watch.&lt;/p&gt;
