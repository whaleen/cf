<!--
   Alternative Right&#39;s Chief Editor, Colin Liddell takes a walk around his local Scottish country park in an &quot;experimental&quot; outdoors podcast. Ignoring interruptions from dog walkers and minor wildlife, he delves into the history of the place – famed for its Victorian &quot;Medieval&quot; tournament – while also considering the significance of Donald Trump, the ideological vacuity of Conservatism, and the essentially regressive nature of Leftism. Other topics include the difference between &quot;troll points&quot; and ideological principles, and the need for the Alt-Right to assert its hegemony over concepts like &quot;humanism,&quot; &quot;progress,&quot; and &quot;modernity&quot; that have been erroneously associated with the Left.           # => "I’ve been hurting to write this ever since we had the idea of creating a Planet for Cubox..." (Continued)

Alternative Right's Chief Editor, Colin Liddell takes a walk around his local Scottish country park in an "experimental" outdoors podcast. Ignoring interruptions from dog walkers and minor wildlife, he delves into the history of the place – famed for its Victorian "Medieval" tournament – while also considering the significance of Donald Trump, the ideological vacuity of Conservatism, and the essentially regressive nature of Leftism. Other topics include the difference between "troll points" and ideological principles, and the need for the Alt-Right to assert its hegemony over concepts like "humanism," "progress," and "modernity" that have been erroneously associated with the Left.<div class="">
