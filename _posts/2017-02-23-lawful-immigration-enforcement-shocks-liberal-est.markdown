<p>Curiously, Democrats and their media never complained when Presidents Clinton and Obama portrayed immigration enforcement as a positive for the American people and the nation-of-laws idea.</p>

<p>It’s welcome and long overdue to see criminal aliens targeted for removal.

The foreigners come to steal American jobs, and when employment disappears they have no reason to stay and are <a href="http://www.limitstogrowth.org/articles/2016/04/24/self-deporting-mexican-finds-success-at-home/">likely to self-deport</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/21/us/politics/dhs-immigration-trump.html"><b>New Trump Deportation Rules Allow Far More Expulsions</b></a>, <em>New York Times</em>, February 21, 2017</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Trump has directed his administration to enforce the nation’s immigration laws more aggressively, unleashing the full force of the federal government to find, arrest and deport those in the country illegally, regardless of whether they have committed serious crimes.</p>
<p>Documents released on Tuesday by the Department of Homeland Security revealed the broad scope of the president’s ambitions: to publicize crimes by undocumented immigrants; strip such immigrants of privacy protections; enlist local police officers as enforcers; erect new detention facilities; discourage asylum seekers; and, ultimately, speed up deportations.</p>
<p>The new enforcement policies put into practice language that Mr. Trump used on the campaign trail, vastly expanding the definition of “criminal aliens” and warning that such unauthorized immigrants “routinely victimize Americans,” disregard the “rule of law and pose a threat” to people in communities across the United States.<span id="more-14778"></span></p>
<p>Despite those assertions in the new documents, research shows lower levels of crime among immigrants than among native-born Americans.</p>
<p>The president’s new immigration policies are likely to be welcomed by some law enforcement officials around the country, who have called for a tougher crackdown on unauthorized immigrants, and by some Republicans in Congress who have argued that lax enforcement encourages a never-ending flow of unauthorized immigrants.</p>
<p>But taken together, the new policies are a rejection of the sometimes more restrained efforts by former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush and their predecessors, who sought to balance protecting the nation’s borders with fiscal, logistical and humanitarian limits on the exercise of laws passed by Congress.</p>
<p>“The faithful execution of our immigration laws is best achieved by using all these statutory authorities to the greatest extent practicable,” John F. Kelly, the secretary of homeland security, wrote in one of two memorandums released on Tuesday. “Accordingly, department personnel shall make full use of these authorities.” . . .</p></blockquote>
