<p>For people who are supposed to be “living in the shadows,” it’s far easier for illegal immigrants to appear on television than those who think immigration laws should be enforced. From the <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/illegal-aliens-the-democrat-national-convention-and-the-high-iq-vdare-readers">Democratic National Convention </a>to <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/defining-america-down-jose-antonio-vargas-yech-and-whats-at-stake-in-the-latest-amnesty-imm">Jose Antonio Vargas</a>, illegal immigrants, many of whom don’t even bother to pretend to be patriotic or respectful towards our country, are constantly lecturing us about how racist and evil we are and, for some reason, why we should reward them for saying so.</p>
<p>Of course, if our country actually was as xenophobic as they claim it was, we wouldn’t have them here and they wouldn’t have the opportunity to guilt trip us into giving our country. As always, a hard line on immigration from the beginning is the best way of avoiding “preventable evils,” <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/enoch-powell-on-merkels-boner">as Enoch Powell said</a>.</p>
<p>Deporting a few of the most arrogant invaders would obviously have a salutary effect and serve <i>pour encourager les autres. </i>And the Trump Administration took a major step in that direction today.</p>
<blockquote><p>Moments after an immigrant spoke out about her fears of deportation, she was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>
<p>Daniela Vargas, 22, was detained by ICE agents Wednesday morning, shortly after speaking at a news conference in downtown Jackson, according to her attorney, Abby Peterson.</p>
<p class="">The news conference was hosted by local immigration attorneys, churches and the Mississippi Immigrants Rights Alliance to bring attention to families impacted by deportation…</p><div id="57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4" class="vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539">    </div>
<p class="">Vargas has no bond and is in ICE detention.</p>
<div id="module-position-PxCXWfTX5Yw" class="story-asset image-asset"> Since she came into the country on a visa waiver program, Vargas could be processed without a hearing, Peterson said.</div>

</blockquote>
<div class="story-asset image-asset">As always, notice the bias in the reporting. Vargas is identified in the headline as an “immigrant,” not an illegal immigrant. The obvious financial stake immigration attorneys (<a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/memo-from-middle-america-refugee-industry-profiteering-so-gross-even-time-magazine-has-noticed">and likely the churches</a>) is not disclosed, nor who is <a href="https://www.guidestar.org/PartnerReport.aspx?ein=94-3425290&amp;Partner=Demo">funding </a>the <a href="http://www.yourmira.org/about/our-history/">“Mississippi Immigrants Rights Alliance.”</a> And there’s the sickening use of “Dreamer” (even by Drudge) to identify this criminal. As President Trump once said, <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/memo-from-middle-america-refugee-industry-profiteering-so-gross-even-time-magazine-has-noticed">what about the dreamers among our own citizens</a>?</div>
<div class="story-asset image-asset"></div>
<div class="story-asset image-asset">Send this invader home. Use strategic deportation to expel these subversives who openly seek to destroy us. And for this next priority, I’d say it’s about time <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/dream-act-poster-boy-jose-antonio-vargas-arrested-by-immigration-authorities-at-last">Jose Antonio Vargas be sent back to the Philippines</a>. It’s time for him to be President Duterte’s problem, not ours.</div>
