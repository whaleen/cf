<p>"Fascism" is everywhere and nowhere. It's "everywhere" in the sense that this social and political movement from the first half of the 20th century is still used as a label for, among other things, liberal regulators, opponents of gay marriage, and pure evil.  Fascism is "nowhere" in the sense that no one seems able to offer a definition of what exactly it is.  </p>

<p>Paul Gottfried joins Richard try to define it.  They discuss whether fascism can be reduced to economic or political policies or whether it is best understood as a style or spirit.  They also ask what inspiration the contemporary non-aligned Right can find in this almost universally denounced political movement.    </p>
