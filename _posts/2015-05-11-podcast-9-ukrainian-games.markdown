   Andy and Colin are joined by Traditionalist Youth Network&#39;s Matt Parrott to trawl through the choppy waters of global geopolitics in the wake of the Ukraine&#39;s remarkable revolution, one that was chiefly driven by forces from the right. 

Up for discussion are Alexander Dugin&#39;s views that the Ukrainian ultra-nationalists who played a leading part are merely &quot;nazis&quot; in a &quot;Quentin Tarantino style circus&quot; playing a proxy role for the West. Also considered is the prospect of the Ukraine breaking up, Putin&#39;s mindset, and whether America and Russia play symbiotically opposite roles. 

Originally aired in February 2014.           # => "Iâ€™ve been hurting to write this ever since we had the idea of creating a Planet for Cubox..." (Continued)

Andy and Colin are joined by Traditionalist Youth Network's Matt Parrott to trawl through the choppy waters of global geopolitics in the wake of the Ukraine's remarkable revolution, one that was chiefly driven by forces from the right. 

Up for discussion are Alexander Dugin's views that the Ukrainian ultra-nationalists who played a leading part are merely "nazis" in a "Quentin Tarantino style circus" playing a proxy role for the West. Also considered is the prospect of the Ukraine breaking up, Putin's mindset, and whether America and Russia play symbiotically opposite roles.
