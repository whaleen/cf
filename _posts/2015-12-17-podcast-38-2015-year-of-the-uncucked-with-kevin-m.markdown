Professor Kevin MacDonald joins Andy and Colin to take a look back at the dramatic events of 2015, a year which saw Syria fall deeper into chaos, the "Muslimmivasion" of Europe by  so-called "refugees," horrific terrorist attacks in Paris and California, and  a fightback of sorts by Eastern European governments, the Front National in France, and most spectacularly of all by the rise of Donald Trump in the GOP primaries.

Has America finally grown weary of talking in riddles to stay on the correct side of political correctness, will Trump be the lightning rod for a populist revival of American democracy, and can the Muslim migrant menace propel Europe into a more identitarian phase? 

Also under discussion are last years predictions — made with Richard Spencer and Michael Enoch — and some new predictions for the year ahead.<div class="">
