<p>Memes have power. Statistics have power. Which of us have not heard the statistic, bandied around universities, that 1 in 3 female college students will be sexually assaulted? Whether or not that statistic is accurate, it is a demonstration of the great ability of “sticky” facts and figures to permeate and influence the public discourse.</p>

<p><span id="more-58985"></span>In this day and age of instant communication, such “stickiness” is a tool of unbelievable power for movements able to harness it. As a case in point closer to home, we recently saw a similar example of “stickiness” in the rise of the term “<a href="http://www.counter-currents.com/2015/07/the-conscience-of-a-cuckservative/" target="_blank">Cuckservative</a>.” The cultivation of such memes allows for a spotlight to be shone on issues and questions of significance within a movement or struggle.</p>

<p>This is important, for the stakes could not be higher in our own struggle. We seek not just to prevent the collapse of Western Civilization, and the death of our heritage and culture, but to protect the very lives of our most vulnerable members. We are in an existential war with opponents who think nothing of raping our children, attacking our elderly, and blowing up our innocents (as we just saw in Paris). Compounding this, we are beset by groups of individuals within our ranks who are doing everything they can to speed up this process of destruction and enslavement.</p>

<p>For anyone who has not read of the events in <a href="http://www.counter-currents.com/tag/rotherham/" target="_blank">Rotherham</a>, and the 1,400+ 11-16 year old white girls who were gang-raped, tortured, and for all intents and purposes enslaved by Muslim immigrants in the UK, the British Government’s <em>Independent Inquiry Into Child Sexual Exploitation In Rotherham (1997-2013)</em>[1] should be a required first step to understanding the horror that besets us. For those, like us, whose minds and souls are already tortured by such knowledge, the most pressing questions revolve around how best to fight this war that is greeting us.</p>

<p>One important component of our struggle must be to awake the sleepwalking masses around us. We must serve as the <a href="http://www.counter-currents.com/2015/11/vanguardism-hope-for-the-future/" target="_blank">vanguard</a> to our broader culture, and one of the first steps in doing so is to spread those “sticky” facts that help the process of awakening take hold.</p>

<p>The statistics below are my attempt at a small contribution to this need.</p>

<p>The population of “Western Europe” is roughly 409 million. The list of nations that fall under the title of “Western Europe” is almost exactly those European countries with large numbers of Muslim immigrants.</p>

<p>According to the Swedish National Council For Crime Prevention, in Sweden, in 2013, 700 women, and 300 children, were raped by Muslims in the first 7 months of the year. They also argue that the real figures are 40%-90% higher than this, but for the sake of being conservative we will utilize the official numbers.[2]</p>
<p>1,000 rapes / 7 months = 142.857 rapes per month in Sweden.</p>

<p>Sweden’s population is 9.415 million.</p>

<p>409 million (the population of Western Europe) divided by 9,415,000 (the population of Sweden) is 43.44</p>

<p>Therefore, one could extrapolate that if rape rates hold true across Western Europe, 43.44 (the ratio of the total Western European population vs the total Swedish population) @ 142.857 (rapes per month in Sweden) = 6,205.896 white women and children raped per month by Muslims in Europe.</p>

<p>Divide that by 30 (days in a month) and you get 206.8632 women and girls in Europe raped every day.</p>

<p>Divide that by 24 (hours in a day) and you get 8.6193 per hour.</p>

<p>Divide 60 (60 minutes in an hour) by 8.6193 and you get 6.96 (we will round this up to 7).</p>

<p>Therefore, this would suggest that a white woman or girl is raped by a Muslim every 7 minutes in Europe.</p>

<p>However . . . these figures do not take into account the massive epidemic of grooming and gang-rape being perpetrated across the continent, most notably in the case of Rotherham.</p>

<p>If we extrapolate from the UK Government’s Inquiry on Rotherham, a far more terrible picture is painted.</p>

<p>In Rotherham 1,400 girls from the ages of 11-16 were repeatedly gang-raped and tortured over a period of 16 years.</p>

<p>The government’s inquiry suggests that each child was raped at least 200 times during their forced period of slavery (or, as the government calls it, “prostitution”)</p>

<p>1,400 girls raped 200 times = 280,000 rapes (this does not include multiple perpetrators raping a single child at once as multiple rapes)</p>

<p>16 years @ 365 days = 5,840 days</p>

<p>5,840 days @ 24 hours = 140,160 hours</p>

<p>140,160 hours @ 60 minutes = 8,409,600 minutes</p>

<p>8,409,600 minutes / 280,000 rapes = 30.034</p>

<p>So in Rotherham during that time a female child was raped once every 30.034 minutes</p>

<p>There have been documented grooming gangs and Muslim-perpetrated child rape across Western Europe. Such events are in absolutely no way limited to the UK, and seem to be equally prevalent across all European nations with large numbers of Muslim immigrants.</p>

<p>Rotherham’s population is 109,691</p>

<p>The population of Western Europe is 409,000,000</p>

<p>109,691 (the population of Rotherham) / 409,000,000 (the population of Western Europe) = .0002681</p>

<p>Rotherham’s population is .0002681 of Western Europe.</p>

<p>2 girls in Rotherham raped per hour (one rape every 30.034 minutes) / .0002681 = 7459.90.</p>

<p>Therefore, if rape rates in Rotherham were equal per capita to the rest of Europe, there would be over 7,000 European women raped by Muslims every hour.</p>

<p>For the sake of the argument, let’s posit that the rape rate in Rotherham was 10 times worse than what it is in Western Europe as a whole.  This seems drastically higher than what it would be in reality, not to mention the fact that all the experts involved felt that the number 1,400 was far lower than the actual number of children raped, but for the sake of the argument let’s just say the events in Rotherham were ten times worse than in Western Europe as a whole.</p>

<p>By such an extrapolation there would be 745.99 female children raped each hour in Europe, plus the original 8.619 women and children raped that we arrived at by extrapolating the numbers of Swedish women and children who reported being raped.</p>

<p>745.99 + 8.169 = 754.159</p>

<p>754.159/60 minutes in an hour = 12.569 European women and children raped per minute</p>

<p>60 seconds in a minute/12.569 = a European woman or child getting raped by Muslims once every 4.77 seconds. We will round 4.77 up to 4.8.</p>

<p>This means that a European woman or child is raped by Muslims every 4.8 seconds in Europe today.</p>

<p>This is an attempt at delineating approximately how many European women and children are raped by Muslims. Obviously this can only be arrived at through extrapolation. While some might quibble with the statistics, its bears repeating one more time that these figures are based only on the <em>reported</em> rapes from Sweden, which the Swedish National Council For Crime Prevention estimated to be 40%-90% <em>below</em> the actual number of rapes that occurred, and through using the official numbers from Rotherham, which the UK government likewise indicated as being a number far less than what actually occurred. In addition to this, the numbers from Rotherham have been extrapolated at a rate of only 10%.</p>
