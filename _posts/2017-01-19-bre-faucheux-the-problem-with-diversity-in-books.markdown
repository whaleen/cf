An audio version of this show is also available here.She joins us for a lively conversation on race, identity, and multiculturalism. We begin by discussing her background, including her education and how she came to be red-pilled. While Bre was initially a liberal, she eventually discovered Alt-Right videos on YouTube, which led her to question everything she had been taught. The growing prevalence of anti-White rhetoric in the West also forced her to realize that diversity threatens the very existence of ethnic Europeans worldwide. We then discuss Bre&rsquo;s YouTube video, &ldquo;The Problem With Diversity in Books&rdquo;, which triggered thousands of liberals, and listen to a few amusing responses from some of them. Our show also explores the West&rsquo;s ongoing demographic transformation, MGTOW, and feminism.<div class="">
