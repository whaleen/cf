   One of Donald Trump&#39;s campaign claims is that he would make much better deals for America. Colin and Andy are joined by Alt-Right contributors Siryako Akda (Philippines) and Daniel Spaulding (Korea) to look at America&#39;s latest deal – the Transpacific Parrtnership, a major new trade treaty that aims to lower tariffs and impose common standards on a culturally diverse group of nations. Is it workable and, if it is, what kind of impact is it likely to have on an America burdened by its growing race problems? Also under discussion is China&#39;s attempts to project its own economic empire, with its &quot;One Road, One Band&quot; strategy.
