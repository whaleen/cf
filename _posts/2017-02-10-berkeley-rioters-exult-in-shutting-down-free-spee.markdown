&lt;p&gt;By Matier &amp;amp; Ross, San Francisco Chronicle, February 8, 2017&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizers of the anti-Milo Yiannopoulos demonstration last week at UC Berkeley that ended in $100,000 worth of window-breaking chaos declared it a “stunningly successful” protest — one they’ll happily repeat if the right-wing provocateur tries to return to campus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4&quot; class=&quot;vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539&quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are happy with the results,” said UC Berkeley Law School alumnus Ronald Cruz of the group By Any Means Necessary, or BAMN. “We were able to meet Mr. Yiannopoulos’ fascist message with massive resistance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An estimated 150 “black bloc” anarchists attacked police with rocks and fireworks and used barricades to smash windows at the student union Feb. 1, forcing the cancellation of Yiannopoulos’ appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are not affiliated with them, but were united in shutting down the Milo event,” Cruz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
