In his latest "Nameless" podcast, Andy Nowicki discusses the embarrassingly obvious degree to which the political and media establishments are currently colluding to make sure that their candidate gets elected president. Andy notes how both the ostensible 'Right' and 'Left' are closing ranks in response to a perceived threat to their shared hegemony. Not unrelatedly, he examines a recent speech delivered by President Obama which fully reveals the hideous overreach of the ruling class in their increasingly desperate bid to shut down free thought and impose ideological conformity, at all costs.
