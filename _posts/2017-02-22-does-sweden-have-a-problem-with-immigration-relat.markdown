<div class="pf-content"><p>Of course not!</p>
<p>We all know, from first principles, that immigrants are Good.</p>
<p>We also know that Sweden’s natives are very, very white, and thus are Bad.</p>
<p>Therefore, we know, both from abstract reason and from documentaries like <em>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</em>, which people <em>are</em> the real problem in Sweden: the nativist white native whites.</p>
<p>From my review in <em>Taki’s Magazine</em>:</p>

<p>The more popular it is to worry over some organized threat, the less of a danger it likely is in reality. After all, if some group or institution was truly fearsome, most people would either be terrified into silence or admiration.</p>
<p>For example, Dan Brown made a fortune off his <em><a href="http://www.isteve.com/Film_The_Da_Vinci_Code.htm">The Da Vinci Code</a></em> pulp novel during this low ebb of the Catholic Church’s powers with a tale of how a nearly omnipotent Church conspires to cover up pagan feminism’s golden age.</p>

Himself a hate-filled lefty nerd, Larsson concocted an elaborate fantasy world for true believers in the conventional wisdom. …</p><!-- TAG START { player: "7518-804336-VDare - Outstream - Rev", owner: "ONE Video by AOL", for: "ONE Video by AOL" - BEINJS } --><div id="57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4" class="vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539">    <script type="text/javascript" src="//delivery.vidible.tv/jsonp/pid=57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4/56bcd17ce4b018167fea5539_bein.js"></script></div><!-- TAG END { date: 07/25/16 } -->
<p>You may have somehow garnered the impression that Sweden is a politically correct social democracy where the main problems women face (<em>qua</em> women) are oppression and rape at the hands of <a href="http://www.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=2683&amp;date=20051214">Muslim immigrants</a> whose traditional misogyny is sometimes excused in the name of multicultural sensitivity. Otherwise, Scandinavia would appear to be a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11525804">feminist utopia</a>.…</p>
<p>But readers of Larsson’s <em>Millennium</em> trilogy, which has sold nearly <a href="http://redirect.viglink.com/?format=go&amp;jsonp=vglnk_148773141387613&amp;key=034153a8f6f990b64f375d12e1cc4572&amp;libId=izgct0w101000nv1000DL1ximazuyalpru&amp;loc=http%3A%2F%2Ftakimag.com%2Farticle%2Ffight_the_imaginary_power%2Fprint%23ixzz4ZNCFhoaF&amp;v=1&amp;out=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2010%2F05%2F23%2Fmagazine%2F23Larsson-t.html%3Fref%3Dgeneral%26src%3Dme%26pagewanted%3Dall&amp;title=Fight%20the%20(Imaginary)%20Power%20-%20Taki%27s%20Magazine&amp;txt=30%20million">30 million books</a>, know better. Larsson fearlessly exposed the true plagues menacing contemporary Sweden: rich Nazis, Christian male chauvinists, rapist legal officials, and two generations of billionaire serial killers—the first preying on Jewish women, the second on immigrant women. …</p></blockquote>
