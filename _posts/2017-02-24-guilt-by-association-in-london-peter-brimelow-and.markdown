<div class="pf-content"><p>On August, 2016, Peter Brimelow<a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/peter-brimelow-talks-via-skype-to-london-art-gallery-ld50"> spoke to a group in London </a>via Skype, a group physically gathered at London art gallery <a href="https://www.ld50gallery.com/hello">LD50. </a></p>
<p>We posted the audio (below).</p>

<p>Now LD50 is being attacked by the Cultural Marxist Left, who are extraordinarily powerful in the London art scene, and for that matter, in Great Britain. People like this imagine that they’re speaking “truth to power” in the phrase made famous by the mendacious Anita Hill. Actually, of course, they’re speaking power to truth:</p>

<p>By Hannah Ellis-Petersen,<em> The Guardian,</em>  February 22, 2017</p>
<p>All this is really, really fake news. The <em>Guardian</em> has a picture of David Duke–taken<a href="http://www.apimages.com/metadata/Index/Associated-Press-Domestic-News-Louisiana-United-/c71a169079e4da11af9f0014c2589dfb/6/1"> thirteen years ago </a>in Louisiana–because, they say “<strong>One</strong> gallery audience member <strong>professed</strong> support” for Duke.</p>
<p>The LD50 Gallery has no connection with us, neither we nor they have any connection with David Duke, nor do any of us have any neo-Nazi connections.  I would like to call on the <em>Guardian</em> in particular to <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/ann-coulter-trump-wins-disavowal-game-then-super-tuesday">disavow </a>Mr. Duke, since it’s they, not we, who are promoting him. A <a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22david%20duke%22+site:theguardian.com">Google Search </a>of the <em>Guardian</em> website shows almost 800 references to a man who was<a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/david-duke-donald-trump-and-the-alt-right"> never very relevant, </a>and who is only being used by them to bash Trump and other patriotic Americans.</p>
<p>I don’t suppose these people can be called off by any appeals to liberty of conscience or freedom of speech, but they should take care. I know a lawyer in London who has a regular practice in suing left-wing news organizations for libeling right-wingers.</p>
<p>Their left-wing news organizations keep having to pay up, because something about the sight of a right-winger makes them abandon all normal British libel law safety practices–and they simply can’t bring themselves to apologize.</p>
