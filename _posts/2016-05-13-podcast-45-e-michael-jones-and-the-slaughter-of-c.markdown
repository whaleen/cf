Alt Right regular Alex Fontana interviews the near legendary E. Michael Jones, an important Catholic critic of America, well known for his book “The Slaughter of Cities,” which details the post-war destruction of America’s White ethnic neighbourhoods and communities as a deliberate policy by WASP and Jewish elites. Among many subjects discussed are the rigged political system, suburbanization as social control, the Black-Jewish alliance, Hollywood, and the rise of Donald Trump.<div class="">
