<!--
   Andy and Colin hook-up with John Morgan of Arktos Publishing and &quot;Charles,&quot; an aspiring (and secretive) Swedish folk musician and writer, to talk about the passing of two men who died on the same day, Nelson Mandela and Colin Wilson. While one was lauded by every outlet of the mainstream media, the other was practically ignored. We also plug Andy&#39;s new book &quot;Lost Violent Souls,&quot; which presents an alternative history of Lee Harvey Oswald. 

This podcast was first aired on the old Alternative Right site on 9th December, 2013, and then on the new Alternative Right site on 26th December, 2013.
