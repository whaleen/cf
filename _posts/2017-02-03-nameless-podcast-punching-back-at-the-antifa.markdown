   In his latest &quot;Nameless&quot; Podcast, Andy Nowicki discusses the manufactured rift between certain self-professed adherents to the &quot;Alt-Right&quot; and those who they derisively title the &quot;Alt-Lite.&quot; This conflict is examined in the context of stepped up attacks by sucker-punching, battery-chucking, violence-embracing antifa scum and heightened fear and loathing in the Lugenpresse towards all factions of the anti-Establishment &quot;rebel alliance,&quot; Right and Lite alike.

Noting how Trump won an incredible victory over an unrelentingly hostile media, and observing the manner in which anti-fascist forces wound up losing the Spanish Civil War, Andy makes a plea for tactical unity and mutual respect between Right and Lite.           # => "Iâ€™ve been hurting to write this ever since we had the idea of creating a Planet for Cubox..." (Continued)
