In his latest "Nameless" Podcast, Andy Nowicki discusses the manufactured rift between certain self-professed adherents to the "Alt-Right" and those who they derisively title the "Alt-Lite." This conflict is examined in the context of stepped up attacks by sucker-punching, battery-chucking, violence-embracing antifa scum and heightened fear and loathing in the Lugenpresse towards all factions of the anti-Establishment "rebel alliance," Right and Lite alike.

Noting how Trump won an incredible victory over an unrelentingly hostile media, and observing the manner in which anti-fascist forces wound up losing the Spanish Civil War, Andy makes a plea for tactical unity and mutual respect between Right and Lite.<div class="">
