By NEAL E. BOUDETTE FEB. 15, 2017</p>
<p><a id="xlink_1_3" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/is-the-traffic-death-spike-like-the-homicide-increase-also-a-ferguson-effect/#xlink_1_3" name="xlink_1_3"></a><em>Last year, traffic deaths increased 6 percent, to 40,200, according to estimates released on Wednesday by the National Safety Council. The two-year increase — 14 percent — is the largest in more than a half a century. </em></p>
<p><a id="xlink_1_4" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/is-the-traffic-death-spike-like-the-homicide-increase-also-a-ferguson-effect/#xlink_1_4" name="xlink_1_4"></a>… According to its estimates, 40,200 people died in accidents involving motor vehicles in 2016, a 6 percent rise from the year before.</p>
<p><a id="xlink_1_5" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/is-the-traffic-death-spike-like-the-homicide-increase-also-a-ferguson-effect/#xlink_1_5" name="xlink_1_5"></a>… The 2016 total comes after a 7 percent rise in 2015 and means the two-year increase — 14 percent — is the largest in more than a half a century. …</p>
<p><a id="xlink_1_6" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/is-the-traffic-death-spike-like-the-homicide-increase-also-a-ferguson-effect/#xlink_1_6" name="xlink_1_6"></a>Part of the increase is believed to stem from the improving economy, which has led Americans to drive more miles for both work and pleasure. But safety advocates say that explains only part of the trend because the number of deaths as a percentage of miles driven is also increasing.</p>
<p><a id="xlink_1_7" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/is-the-traffic-death-spike-like-the-homicide-increase-also-a-ferguson-effect/#xlink_1_7" name="xlink_1_7"></a>They also point to data suggesting an increase in distracted driving. While cars and phones now offer advanced voice controls and other features intended to keep drivers’ eyes on the road, apps like Facebook, Google Maps, Snapchat and others have created new temptations that drivers and passengers find hard to resist.</p>
<p><a id="xlink_1_8" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/is-the-traffic-death-spike-like-the-homicide-increase-also-a-ferguson-effect/#xlink_1_8" name="xlink_1_8"></a>“It’s not just talking on the phone that’s a problem today,” said Jonathan Adkins, executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association. “You now have all these other apps that people can use on their phones.”</p></blockquote>
<p><a id="xlink_1_9" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/is-the-traffic-death-spike-like-the-homicide-increase-also-a-ferguson-effect/#xlink_1_9" name="xlink_1_9"></a>Another concern I have is that the high tech safety equipment on new cars might be backfiring for some reason. This could be tested by looking at what kind of cars are having these fatal accidents.</p>
<blockquote><p><a id="xlink_1_10" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/is-the-traffic-death-spike-like-the-homicide-increase-also-a-ferguson-effect/#xlink_1_10" name="xlink_1_10"></a> Government officials and safety advocates contend, however, that more than anything else, the increase in deaths has been caused by more lenient enforcement of seatbelt, drunken driving and speeding regulations by authorities and a reluctance by lawmakers to pass more restrictive measures.</p></blockquote>
<p><a id="xlink_1_11" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/is-the-traffic-death-spike-like-the-homicide-increase-also-a-ferguson-effect/#xlink_1_11" name="xlink_1_11"></a>Okay, but that just sounds like officials saying what they are officially supposed to say.</p>
<blockquote><p><a id="xlink_1_12" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/is-the-traffic-death-spike-like-the-homicide-increase-also-a-ferguson-effect/#xlink_1_12" name="xlink_1_12"></a> A patchwork of state laws leaves many areas where drivers can choose not to buckle up, with little likelihood of being stopped.</p><!-- TAG START { player: "7518-804336-VDare - Outstream - Rev", owner: "ONE Video by AOL", for: "ONE Video by AOL" - BEINJS } --><div id="57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4" class="vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539">    <script type="text/javascript" src="//delivery.vidible.tv/jsonp/pid=57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4/56bcd17ce4b018167fea5539_bein.js"></script></div><!-- TAG END { date: 07/25/16 } --></blockquote>
<p><a id="xlink_1_13" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/is-the-traffic-death-spike-like-the-homicide-increase-also-a-ferguson-effect/#xlink_1_13" name="xlink_1_13"></a>Okay but would be a more prima facie plausible argument for why death rates on the roads aren’t falling as fast, not why they have been going up relative to 2014.</p>
<blockquote><p><a id="xlink_1_14" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/is-the-traffic-death-spike-like-the-homicide-increase-also-a-ferguson-effect/#xlink_1_14" name="xlink_1_14"></a> Only 18 states have laws requiring seatbelts for both front and rear occupants and categorize not wearing them as a primary offense — meaning drivers can be pulled over for that alone. In 15 states, failure to wear a seatbelt in front seats is only a secondary offense — drivers cannot be given tickets unless they are pulled over for other violations.</p>
<p><a id="xlink_1_15" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/is-the-traffic-death-spike-like-the-homicide-increase-also-a-ferguson-effect/#xlink_1_15" name="xlink_1_15"></a>“It’s still the same things that are killing drivers — belts, booze and speed,” Mr. Adkins said.</p></blockquote>
<p><a id="xlink_1_16" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/is-the-traffic-death-spike-like-the-homicide-increase-also-a-ferguson-effect/#xlink_1_16" name="xlink_1_16"></a>No doubt, but why the change since 2014?</p>
<blockquote><p><a id="xlink_1_17" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/is-the-traffic-death-spike-like-the-homicide-increase-also-a-ferguson-effect/#xlink_1_17" name="xlink_1_17"></a> In Alabama, steady budget cuts have resulted in a decline in the number of troopers patrolling the state’s 103,000 miles of highways.</p></blockquote>
<p><a id="xlink_1_18" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/is-the-traffic-death-spike-like-the-homicide-increase-also-a-ferguson-effect/#xlink_1_18" name="xlink_1_18"></a>Okay, there’s finally a change in inputs. But, say, governments in California had a lot more money in 2016 than a few years before.</p>
<blockquote><p><a id="xlink_1_19" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/is-the-traffic-death-spike-like-the-homicide-increase-also-a-ferguson-effect/#xlink_1_19" name="xlink_1_19"></a> …“I think speeding is the No. 1 problem. There are times of the day when we only have one or two troopers on duty in a county, so you can speed, and there’s no one there to deter it.”</p></blockquote>
<p><a id="xlink_1_20" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/is-the-traffic-death-spike-like-the-homicide-increase-also-a-ferguson-effect/#xlink_1_20" name="xlink_1_20"></a>Maybe what’s happening is that we’re seeing another manifestation of the Ferguson Effect. As you’ll recall, as the Obama Administration’s narrative about Ferguson <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/ferguson-turns-out-to-be-another-trayvon-style-fiasco">turned out to be Fake News, </a>the Administration ran a massive investigation of the Ferguson Police Department and found … that Ferguson was a <a title="http://www.unz.com/isteve/a-cynical-take-on-the-endless-ferguson-hoopla/" href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/a-cynical-take-on-the-endless-ferguson-hoopla-its-about-gentrification">Speed Trap</a>!</p>
<p><a id="xlink_1_21" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/is-the-traffic-death-spike-like-the-homicide-increase-also-a-ferguson-effect/#xlink_1_21" name="xlink_1_21"></a>For awhile this was the worst thing in the history of the world and the Justice Department used their Speed Trap to take over the Ferguson police department.</p>
<p><a id="xlink_1_22" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/is-the-traffic-death-spike-like-the-homicide-increase-also-a-ferguson-effect/#xlink_1_22" name="xlink_1_22"></a>So, if the Obama Administration is out to abolish Speed Traps, the cops have a remedy: America has plenty of donut shops.</p>
<p><a id="xlink_1_23" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/is-the-traffic-death-spike-like-the-homicide-increase-also-a-ferguson-effect/#xlink_1_23" name="xlink_1_23"></a>With the huge rise in homicide rates since 2014, it’s quite clear that the spikes are often centered in cities with massive Black Lives Matter agitation. In contrast, I haven’t seen any data about where road deaths are up. But it deserves looking into.</p>
<p><a id="xlink_1_24" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/is-the-traffic-death-spike-like-the-homicide-increase-also-a-ferguson-effect/#xlink_1_24" name="xlink_1_24"></a>Whatever the causes, they shouldn’t be a mystery for too long because insurance companies have a lot of data on vehicle fatalities.</p>
