<div class="pf-content"><p>The Radio Derb transcript is up for February 10. Go <a href="http://www.vdare.com/radios/radio-derb-justice-may-be-blind-but-judges-arent-etc">here </a>to read or listen. Sample:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Berkeley riot did come to mind again when I was reading <a href="http://nypost.com/2017/02/09/actually-trump-has-a-duty-to-ban-dangerous-immigrants/">Seth Lipsky&#8217;s Thursday column</a> in the <em>New York Post</em>, though.</p>
<p>Seth was actually writing about the immigration issue; but along the way he mentioned the Obligation Clauses in the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>Our Constitution of course lists things the government <em>can</em> do, and things the government <em>can&#8217;t</em> do. In one section, though, it lists some things the government <em>must</em> do. These are the Obligation Clauses.</p><!-- TAG START { player: "7518-804336-VDare - Outstream - Rev", owner: "ONE Video by AOL", for: "ONE Video by AOL" - BEINJS } --><div id="57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4" class="vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539">    <script type="text/javascript" src="//delivery.vidible.tv/jsonp/pid=57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4/56bcd17ce4b018167fea5539_bein.js"></script></div><!-- TAG END { date: 07/25/16 } -->
<p>Here&#8217;s the entire Section: United States Constitution, Article IV, Section 4, quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against Invasion; and on Application of the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened) against domestic Violence.</p></blockquote>
<p>End quote. If what we saw at Berkeley the other day was not &#8220;domestic violence,&#8221; I don&#8217;t know what it was. Why did the<a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/ruthless-coercion-not-used-at-berkeley-but-federal-authorities-could-use-ruthless-coercion-on-berkeley"> State of California not suppress it</a>; or, if they could not do so, call on the federal government to suppress it, as the Constitution would then require?</p></blockquote>
