<img align="left" hspace="12" alt="No, Fox News &amp; Trump Aren&rsquo;t Lying About Sweden" src="https://rdice.net/a/c/n/17/02202016-Stortorget_in_Malm23.9cd7b47f.jpg"> Aftonbladet is probably the biggest newspaper in Sweden. When Donald Trump mentioned what happened “last night in Sweden” they were quick to mock him, and soon followed up with a serious article attempting to debunk Ami Horowitz documentary Stockholm Syndrome. It’s just a shame it’s full of fallacies. Let’s begin. Claim: “Weapons crime and rapes have risen since Sweden opened its borders.” Aftonbladets reply: In 2015 there were 5 290 reported rapes, a 12 percent decrease compared to 2014. As you can clearly see in their own linked source, sex crimes have doubled since 2012. They decreased a little in 2014, only to rise again in 2015. So the way they selectively pick and choose here is devious. I’d also like to mention that women’s comfortability with reporting crime has actually gone down.&#8230;<div class="">
