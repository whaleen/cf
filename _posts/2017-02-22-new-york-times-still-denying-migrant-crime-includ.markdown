<div class="pf-content"><p>Reporting about the riots in Sweden, supposedly due to President Trump&#8217;s comments about migrant rape, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/21/world/europe/stockholm-sweden-riots-trump.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=b-lede-package-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news"><em>The New York Times</em> claims</a> the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>Swedish officials have criticized his statements as exaggerations.<a href="http://www.bra.se/download/18.37179ae158196cb172e1b34/1484209811093/Sammanfattning_anmalda_prel_helar_2016.pdf"> Preliminary statistics</a> do not show a major increase in crime from 2015, when the country processed a record 163,000 asylum applications, to 2016. Riots like the one in Rinkeby, officials said, are not unprecedented but are infrequent.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Times’s link goes to an untranslated document, so we have to take the Times at its word that the data do not show a “major increase.” And what is a “major increase?” Who decides that?</p>
<p>Whether and how much crime has increased since 2015 misses Trump’s point. That is not the question. The question is how much crime has increased <em>since immigrants began flooding the country.</em></p>
<p>Suppose a certain area of Sweden suffered 50 rapes in 2015 and 52 in 2016, a 4 percent increase. Is that a “major increase?” It’s a 100 percent increase for the woman who has never been raped.</p>
<p>But that 4 percent, again, is irrelevant to Trump’s point. Before the migrant invasion, Sweden was virtually rape free. If the same area reported three rapes in 1995, then the increase between then and 2016 is 1633 percent. Is that a “major increase?”</p>
<p><a href="http://fjordman.blogspot.com/2005/02/muslim-rape-epidemic-in-sweden-and.html">Fjordman reported</a> a “sharp rise” in 2005. Here is what was happening in Malmö:</p><!-- TAG START { player: "7518-804336-VDare - Outstream - Rev", owner: "ONE Video by AOL", for: "ONE Video by AOL" - BEINJS } --><div id="57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4" class="vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539">    <script type="text/javascript" src="//delivery.vidible.tv/jsonp/pid=57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4/56bcd17ce4b018167fea5539_bein.js"></script></div><!-- TAG END { date: 07/25/16 } -->
<blockquote><p>Thomas Anderberg, responsible for statistics at the Malmö Police, says there was a doubling of the number of reported rapes by ambush in 2004, following what was already a decade of steadily increasing numbers of sexual crime</p></blockquote>
<p>But at least the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/21/world/europe/stockholm-sweden-riots-trump.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=b-lede-package-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news">Times acknowledges</a> a problem. Here are the last four paragraphs of its story:</p>
<blockquote><p>Benjamin Dousa, 24, an appointed member of a local board in Rinkeby that distributes public money for schools, social services, parks and recreation and<a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/elder-care/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier"> elder care</a>, offered a less sanguine view than Mr. Derk.</p>
<p>Mr. Dousa, in an opinion essay for the newspaper <em>Expressen</em>, said that Mr. Trump’s critique had some merit.</p>
<p>“A battered journalist, stones thrown at the police and stores that are being plundered, unfortunately, are not unusual occurrences where I live,” he said. “I hear the police helicopter every other day.”</p>
<p>He said that in the neighborhood: “This type of criminality has become part of everyday life: On average, we have one outbreak of violence a month, a car fire every day and the most shootings with deadly outcomes in the country. Would this really be accepted where the prime minister lives?”</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, as <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/muslim-immigration-means-sexual-jihad">I reported</a> in 2012, Muslim immigration means sexual jihad.</p>
