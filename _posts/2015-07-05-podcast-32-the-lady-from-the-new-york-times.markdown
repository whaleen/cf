Following the Charleston Church Shooting, Big Media has ignored all sorts of interesting angles on the case, such as mental disease, the effects of pharmaceuticals, the hollowing out of the American middle class, visceral rage caused by Black-on-White crime, and even the shooter's  incongruous friendships with Blacks. They are much more interested in the "Satanic power" of the Confederate flag and the "corrupting influence" of the internet, especially as it undermines their own media power. We were not too surprised therefore when the New York Times requested an interview through one of their Pulitzer-prize-winning reporters, Stephanie Saul. In order to provide a counter reference for any misquotations or decontextualizations of my words, I am making the full interview public.<div class="">
