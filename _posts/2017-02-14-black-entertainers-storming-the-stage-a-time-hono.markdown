&lt;p&gt;It’s a time-honored tradition for black entertainers to storm the stage in outrage when they lose an award. For example, here’s Ol’ Dirty Bastard at the 1998 Grammy Awards protesting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went and bought me an outfit today that costed a lot of money, today. You know what I mean, because I figured that Wu-Tang was gonna win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4&quot; class=&quot;vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539&quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we need more of this. I want to see Denzel Washington yank the Oscar out of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=ryan+gosling+oscars+2017&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&quot;&gt;Ryan Gosling’s &lt;/a&gt;hands and pistol whip his Canadian ass with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these troubled times, that would bring America together.&lt;/p&gt;
