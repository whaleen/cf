<p>By GLORIA STEINEM MARCH 2, 2017</p>
<p><a id="xlink_1_3" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/#xlink_1_3" name="xlink_1_3"></a>I was on a flight from New York to Seattle when a long delay on the tarmac prompted the airline to offer us a free movie. As the flight attendant read the choices aloud, a young man across the aisle said, “I don’t watch chick flicks!”</p>
<p><a id="xlink_1_4" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/#xlink_1_4" name="xlink_1_4"></a>… He would also be rewarded by such irresistible movies as “Hidden Figures,” about three African-American women whose brainpower fueled the American space program, or two such universal stories as the lost boys and found men in “Lion” and “Moonlight.”</p><div id="57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4" class="vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539">    </div>
<p><a id="xlink_1_5" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/#xlink_1_5" name="xlink_1_5"></a>These movies meet the “chick flick” entry-level test of being more about people than special effects, more about relationships than chases. And in the Academy Awards season that just closed, all three went a long way toward ending the division of human beings into the powerful but made-up categories of race and gender. …</p></blockquote>
<p><a id="xlink_1_6" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/#xlink_1_6" name="xlink_1_6"></a>Yet, for some mysterious reason, the members of the made-up category of “actresses” haven’t been enthusiastic about competing for Oscars against the members of the made-up category of “actors.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Editors’ Note: March 2, 2017 </em></p>
<p><em>Because of a misunderstanding by the editors, it was discovered only after publication that this article reproduces in substantial part an essay by the same writer that appeared on the Women’s Media Center website in 2007 and was republished by other outlets. It is not The Times’s policy to print previously published work without attribution. In addition, the article referred incorrectly to the timing of a flight during which “chick flicks” were mentioned. It was not “recently,” the flight having occurred in 2007.</em></p></blockquote>
