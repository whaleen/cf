<p>And now spring comes to the starved and blackened land<br>
where the tailless abominable angel has spent his passion;<br>
dead roots are twined through the bones of a broken hand;<br>
now death, not Schiaparelli, sets the fashion.</p>
<p>In the twentieth century of the Christian era<br>
the news-hawk camera man, no Botticelli,<br>
walks on this stricken earth with Primavera,<br>
and Europe cries from the heart of her hungry belly. <span id="more-53096"></span></p>
<p>Ten flattened centuries are heaped with rubble,<br>
ten thousand vultures wheel above the plain;<br>
honour is lost and hope is like a bubble;<br>
life is defeated, thought itself is pain.</p>
<p>But the bones of Charlemagne will rise and dance,<br>
and the spark unquenched will kindle into flame.<br>
And the voices heard by the small maid of France<br>
will speak yet again, and give this void a Name.</p>
