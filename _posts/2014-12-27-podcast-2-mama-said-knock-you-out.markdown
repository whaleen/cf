   Andy and Colin are joined by Charles to discuss the &quot;The Knockout Game&quot; a spate of random attacks by Blacks against non-Blacks that seem to be motivated by racial hatred. Colin explains the role that Whites play in this game with their own game &quot;The Blankout Game,&quot; in which they foolishly feign race blindness, leaving themselves open to these attacks. This podcast was originally aired on the 18th of December, 2013, on the old Alternative Right site.
