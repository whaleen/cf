Andy and Colin are joined by Charles to discuss the "The Knockout Game" a spate of random attacks by Blacks against non-Blacks that seem to be motivated by racial hatred. Colin explains the role that Whites play in this game with their own game "The Blankout Game," in which they foolishly feign race blindness, leaving themselves open to these attacks. This podcast was originally aired on the 18th of December, 2013, on the old Alternative Right site.
