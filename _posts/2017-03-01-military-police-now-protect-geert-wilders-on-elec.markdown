<p>The 53-year-old, who is currently riding high in the opinion polls, had been forced to cancel all public events after revelations of leaks from the police team guarding him.</p>
<p>The Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) leader had been living under 24-hour police protection since an Islamist militant’s 2004 murder of fellow Islam critic Theo van Gogh.</p>

<p>Mr Wilders had been forced to cancel all public appearances ahead of the Dutch vote on March 15 after it emerged that a member of the protection squad – identified only as Faris K – had leaked information to Moroccan criminal gangs.</p>
<p>After revealing the SAB was bolstering Mr Wilders’ security, the PVV leader said in a statement: “Voters want to see us. The security risks will be kept to a minimum.”</p>
<p>SAB is also tasked with protecting Dutch politicians and officials when they travel abroad.</p>
