<div class="pf-content"><p>Black reporter Juan Thompson, charged with making some but not necessarily all of the recent threats against synagogues, is a black reporter who was <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/03/03/statement-on-the-arrest-of-former-intercept-reporter-juan-thompson/">fired from <em>The Intercept </em></a>for extreme fake news.</p>
<p>Like<a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/the-son-of-sullivan-and-the-invisible-victim"> Jayson Blair</a>, he was just making stuff up. [<em><a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/the-intercept-issues-mass-correction-after-writer-caught-fabricating-quotes/">The Intercept Issues Mass Correction After Writer Caught Fabricating Quotes </a></em>by Alex Griswold, MediaIte, February 2nd, 2016]</p>
<p>The <em>New York Times,</em> as noted by <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/synagogue-threats-apparently-by-black-muslim-reporter-who-is-trying-to-blame-his-white-girlfriend-st-louis-man-charged">Eugene Gant,</a> covered this as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/nyregion/jewish-centers-bomb-threats-arrest.html"><em>St. Louis Man Charged With Making Bomb Threats Against Jewish Sites</em> </a>by Benjamin Weiser, March 3, 2017 .  <em>Earlier </em>coverage of the same threats by the same paper came out like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/28/us/jewish-community-center-donald-trump.html">Threats and Vandalism Leave American Jews on Edge in Trump Era,</a></em> February 28, 2017</li>
</ul>
<p>But it seems that if we’re talking about an angry black <a href="https://archive.is/iBtl8">Muslim  </a>Affirmative Action case, fired for fraud and incompetence, making bomb threats against Jewish sites, we’re not talking about the “Trump Era”–we’re talking about the age of Obama.</p>
<p>Trump, and his mostly white, Christian supporters are <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/the-trump-wrecking-ball-the-washington-cartel-and-the-jews">not anti-Semites</a>.</p><div id="57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4" class="vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539">    </div>
<p>Here are two quotes on that.</p>
<p>The Jewish Telegraph Agency:</p>
<blockquote><p>Trump is from New York, works in professions saturated with Jews and long has been a vocal supporter of Israel. His daughter and two grandchildren are Jewish, the executive vice president of his organization is Jewish — and Trump certainly has chutzpah.[<a href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/when-it-comes-to-jewish-ties-no-gop-candidate-trumps-trump/?utm_source=The+Times+of+Israel+Daily+Edition&amp;utm_campaign=9c90fa8ce3-2015_08_08&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_adb46cec92-9c90fa8ce3-55128077"><em>When it comes to Jewish ties, no GOP candidate trumps Trump</em></a><em>, </em>by Uriel Heilman, Jewish Telegraph Agency, August 8, 2015]</p></blockquote>
<p>Lion of the Blogosphere:</p>
<blockquote><p>If Trump becomes president he will be the most culturally Jewish president in American history. His daughter is Jewish, and probably a plurality of his top employees are Jewish. …</p>
<p>Also, Trump once served as the grand marshal of the Salute to Israel Parade.</p>
<p><a href="https://lionoftheblogosphere.wordpress.com/2015/12/14/irony-of-trump-and-white-nationalists/"><em>Irony Of Trump And White Nationalists</em></a>, December 14, 2015</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s Trump. Barack Hussein Obama, on the other hand, supported and was supported by black Muslims, including Louis Farrakhan and Al Sharpton. This is a typical Obama supporter crime. See if anyone calls it that.</p>
<p>But what ties Jayson Blair, the black reporter who was fired from the NYT in 2003 for<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Blair"> lies and plagiarism,  </a>Juan Thompson, fired from a news site for almost exactly the same thing, and Barack Obama, whose presidency will be remembered for spawning riots and murders across America, are two things.</p>
<ul>
<li>They were all Angry Black Men</li>
<li>They were all Affirmative Action cases.</li>
</ul>
