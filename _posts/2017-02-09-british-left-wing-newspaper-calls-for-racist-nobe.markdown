"I would be excited about voting if I was in Germany."</span></blockquote></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The article quotes data compiled by Stuart Anderson of the National Foundation for American Policy that found 40% of Nobel Prizes won by Americans in chemistry, medicine, and physics since 2000 were won by immigrants from a handful of White or East Asian populations. These included Japanese, Canadians, Germans, Austrian, Jews, and White South Africans.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The article is a clear call to limit immigration from countries that perform badly at the Nobel prize, such as most Latin American countries, all Middle Eastern countries (except Israel), all Sub-Saharan countries (except Whites from South Africa), and many South Asian countries. As such it is probably the most racist article to ever appear in <i>The Independent</i>.<br /><br /><form action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post" style="text-align: justify;" target="_top"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><input alt="PayPal - The safer, easier way to pay online!" border="0" name="submit" src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donateCC_LG.gif" type="image" />&nbsp;<img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/scr/pixel.gif" width="1" /></span></div></form></div></div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/SBfLZ/~4/FhtDkhD06SE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/><div class="">
