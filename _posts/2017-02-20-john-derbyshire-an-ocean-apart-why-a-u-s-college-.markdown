<p><span style="color: #993300;">[<em>Adapted from the <a href="http://www.vdare.com/radios/radio-derb-february-17th">latest </a>Radio Derb, now available <a href="http://www.vdare.com/radios">exclusively </a>on VDARE.com.</em>]</span></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve met more than my share of famous people, just because I&#8217;ve lived mostly in big metropolises and hung around with journalists a lot. Among those encounters: one with His Holiness the Dalai Lama, back in 1984. I wrote up an account in a <a href="http://www.johnderbyshire.com/Opinions/China/tibetslongagony.html">column</a> back in 2003.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vdare-live/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/19223444/diverse.jpg" width="225" align="right" />Well, His Holiness is still among us here in the material world; now 81 years old, but still doing speaking engagements. One of those engagements has caused<a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/diversity-means-beijing-must-rule-all-under-heaven"> a bit of a fuss</a> over on the <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/the-ninth-circuit-the-left-coast-versus-america">Left Coast</a>. Here&#8217;s the nub of it:</p>
<blockquote><p>Chinese students are joining their peers on American campuses in getting woke. Their cause? Defending the official line of the Communist Party.</p>
<p>On Feb. 2, the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) <a href="http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/feature/tenzin_gyatso_his_holiness_the_14th_dalai_lama_to_speak_at_uc_san_diego">formally announced</a> that the Dalai Lama would make a keynote speech at the June commencement ceremony.</p>
<p>The announcement triggered outrage among Chinese students who view the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader as an oppressive figure threatening to divide a unified China. A group of them now plans to meet with the university chancellor to discuss the content of the upcoming speech.</p>
<p>#CHINESESTUDENTSMATTER</p>
<p><em><a href="https://qz.com/908922/chinese-students-at-ucsd-are-evoking-diversity-to-justify-their-opposition-to-the-dalai-lamas-graduation-speech/">Chinese students in the US are using “inclusion” and “diversity” to oppose a Dalai Lama graduation speech</a></em></p>
<p>By Josh Horwitz, Quartz.com, February 15, 2017</p></blockquote>
<p>The rest of the story is hard to read with a straight face. These <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/white-people-so-racist-they-dont-notice-chinese-scamming-them-on-sat">Chinese students</a> at an<a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/chinese-students-in-american-colleges-passing-tests-ted-kennedy-style-by-hiring-imposters-to-take-the-tests"> American university</a>—a <em>tax-payer supported</em> <em>public</em> <em>university</em>, yet—have twisted the language of political correctness—&#8221;inclusion&#8221; &#8220;diversity,&#8221; &#8220;respect,&#8221; and so on—to enforce<a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/importing-sino-fascism"> the line of the Chinese Communist Party </a>that His Holiness is a scheming terrorist<a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/john-derbyshire-says-china-really-feels-it-s-a-victim-nation-handle-with-care"> who seeks to destroy China.</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s all preposterous enough, but the underlying issues are nontrivial.</p>
<p>A lot of these Chinese students are quite sincere. Nobody in China ever hears anything about <a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=China%20Tibet%20+site:johnderbyshire.com">Tibet </a>but the official line. <a href="http://www.johnderbyshire.com/Opinions/China/tibetchicago.html">They believe it</a>. Since their parents are paying full tuition—tens of thousands of dollars—they are entitled to feel that they shouldn&#8217;t be insulted by the presence of a speaker who, as they have been told all their lives, is <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/has-the-asian-tiger-gone-tiger">plotting against their home country.</a></p>
<p>Some others among the students—my guess would be somewhere between twenty and thirty percent—know that the Communist Party line is a lie. However, they also know that the Chinese government monitors its citizens, both at home and abroad, very closely. If you think privacy is an issue here in the age of <a href="http://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/big-data-how-data-analytics-is-transforming-the-world.html">Big Data</a>, try imagining how much privacy there is for Chinese people, under a government unrestrained by any constitutional protections.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-107597" title="" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vdare-live/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/19230848/pad.jpg" alt="" width="225" align="right" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vdare-live/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/19230848/pad.jpg 787w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vdare-live/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/19230848/pad-150x127.jpg 150w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vdare-live/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/19230848/pad-300x253.jpg 300w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vdare-live/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/19230848/pad-768x648.jpg 768w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vdare-live/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/19230848/pad-441x372.jpg 441w" sizes="(max-width: 787px) 100vw, 787px" />If you&#8217;re a Chinese citizen, just for the authorities to know you were in the same room as the Dalai Lama could wreck your life. So even students who haven&#8217;t swallowed the ChiCom lies are rightly fearful.</p>
<p>Well, all that is a problem for Chinese people. But why is it any problem for us?</p>
<p>Why is the chancellor of an American university—<em>a public university, on a salary paid out of tax receipts from American citizens</em>—why is he being vexed by delegations of <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/california-reports-explosive-growth-of-foreign-students"><em>foreign students</em> </a>urging him to enforce the dogmas of a <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/other-peoples-nationalism-china"><em>foreign Communist party</em>?</a></p>
<p>Short answer: <em>Because <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/wealthy-foreign-students-remain-popular-among-californias-university-bean-counters">our immigration system</a> is nuts</em>.</p>
<p>Further down the <em>Quartz</em> news story, we that:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>More overseas Chinese students are studying in the US than ever before</em>. According to the Institute of International Education, more than 304,000 international students were attending university in the US during the 2014-2015 academic year, <em>marking a nearly fivefold increase from a decade prior</em>. [Emphases added]</p></blockquote>

<p><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/518ER3EEJML.jpg" width="225" align="right" />Why are we issuing that many student visas? Our universities are a resource, a great educational resource. That <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/nyt-complains-trump-doesnt-respect-the-narrative-under-his-presidency-the-american-dream-would-be-primarily-reserved-for-americans">resource should be for the benefit of <em>our</em> people.</a></p>
<p>If you say things like that out loud, of course, you mark yourself down as a <em>hater</em>.</p>
<p>Well, the hell with that. I&#8217;ve been living among Chinese people for forty-five years. I&#8217;ve been married to one <a href="http://www.johnderbyshire.com/FamilyAlbum/Huntington2012/page.html#pearl">for thirty years</a>. I&#8217;ve written two novels with Chinese protagonists sympathetically (<a href="http://www.johnderbyshire.com/Books/Coolidge/Lecture/page.html"><em>Seeing Calvin Coolidge In A Dream</em></a> and <a href="http://www.johnderbyshire.com/Books/Fire/page.html"><em>Fire From The Sun)</em></a> But I love my country and I think her citizens should have first claim on her abundance. That&#8217;s not hate.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll tell you what I hate: I hate the stupid, bogus, degraded vocabulary of &#8220;<a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/nyt-masked-berkeley-blackshirts-beating-dissenters-not-hate-michelangelos-david-hate">hate</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/whos-the-bigot-mr-brown">bigotry</a>&#8221; and &#8220;exclusion&#8221; that is now the<a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/the-left-projects-its-own-rage-fear-paranoia-bigotry-and-wait-for-it-hate-on-donald-trump"> default vocabulary for talking about national issues.</a> I sure do hate <em>that</em>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not as if the universities who admit all these foreign students are doing it from high morality and a sincere desire to improve the world.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re doing it for <em>money</em>: foreign students pay full tuition. It&#8217;s not an open-hearted spirit of national generosity: it&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/california-auditor-slams-universities-for-favoring-non-residents-by-lowering-standards">cash racket.</a> [Ker-<a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/03/29/state-audit-university-of-california-lowered-admission-standards-for-out-of-state-students/"><em>ching</em></a>.]</p>
<p>So there&#8217;s another action point on immigration for you, Mr. President: <em>a ceiling on student visas</em>.</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s a slogan to go with it: &#8220;American schools for American citizens!&#8221;</p>
<p>To play us out, here&#8217;s a glimpse of the other side.</p>
<p><img title="" src="http://www.johnderbyshire.com/Books/Fire/cover_l.jpg" width="225" align="left" />I do <em>not</em> mean the other <em>political</em> side. God forbid <em>everything</em> should be about politics! No, this is the human side—the personal, not the social.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.johnderbyshire.com/Opinions/Straggler/009.html">listened </a>to a lot of <a href="http://www.johnderbyshire.com/Opinions/China/2001diary.html">Chinese pop music </a>this past forty-odd years. Most of it is forgettable dross, of course, like pop music anywhere. But there&#8217;s also some surprisingly good stuff.</p>
<p>One thing I&#8217;ve noticed, <a href="http://www.johnderbyshire.com/Readings/yeliyi2.html">from the very beginning</a>, is what a high proportion of Chinese pop ballads are laments for unwilling separation across the width of an ocean for a period of unknown length. That&#8217;s just a cultural reflection of the fact that so many young Chinese people—people in those romantic late teens and early twenties—were g<a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/chinese-visa-mill-scammer-gets-16-years-in-slammer">oing abroad to study,</a> leaving their sweethearts behind.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a random sample of the genre, one of hundreds. This is the late <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-melancholy-pop-idol-who-haunts-china">Teresa Teng</a>, who died <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Teresa_Teng&amp;oldid=765229705">tragically young</a>,  singing in Cantonese. The song title is 一水隔天涯, which translates as &#8220;An Ocean Apart.&#8221;</p>
<p>See what I mean?</p>
