<p>The Left is stark raving mad that the U.S. government actually enforced the laws of the land against illegal immigrants last week. <a href="https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/statement-secretary-kelly-recent-ice-enforcement-actions">As new Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly said in a Feb. 13 press release</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>ICE officers in the Los Angeles, Chicago, Atlanta, San Antonio and New York City areas of responsibility arrested more than 680 individuals who pose a threat to public safety, border security or the integrity of our nation’s immigration system. Of those arrested, approximately 75 percent were criminal aliens, convicted of crimes including, but not limited to, homicide, aggravated sexual abuse, sexual assault of a minor, lewd and lascivious acts with a child, indecent liberties with a minor, drug trafficking, battery, assault, DUI and weapons charges.</p></blockquote>
<p>Can you imagine getting up in arms over a few hundred child molesters, drug dealers and rapists? The Left’s insanity gets worse and worse by the day.</p>
<p>So, (1) since they’re already hysterical, (2) we want our country back, and (3) it’s the legal and moral thing to do, here’s a quick explanation of how to identify and report suspected illegal immigrants.</p>
<h4>What is an illegal immigrant?</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWe2Y5nTj8A">As the Federation for American Immigration Reform explains</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>Under federal law, any non-U.S. citizen is an alien. <strong>Aliens who have entered the United States without permission, or who have violated the terms of their admission, are identified under the law as illegal aliens. That is a fact, not an issue for debate.</strong></p>
<p>It doesn’t matter whether someone crossed our nation’s borders illegally or overstayed a visa, their presence in the country is illegal which makes them deportable under the Immigration and Nationality Act. According to the law…<strong>“Any alien who is present in the United States in violation of this Act or any other law of the United States is deportable.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<h4>To whom do I report a suspected illegal immigrant?</h4>
<p>The Immigration and Customs Enforcement division of the Department of Homeland Security handles deportations. ICE has a central hotline to which you can send your information.</p>
<p>If you’d like to report your tip over the Internet, <a href="https://www.ice.gov/webform/hsi-tip-form">use the Homeland Security Investigation Tip Form located here</a>, fill it out completely, and let the good guys get to work on that intel.</p>
<p>If you’d like to make a phone call instead, call 1-866-347-2423 (1-866-DHS-2-ICE).</p>
<p>You can also potentially reach out to one of the 26 HSI Principal Field Offices around the country. They’re mainly in states on our nation’s borders and coasts, but there is also an office in Chicago and one in Denver. <a href="https://www.ice.gov/contact/hsi">The full list is here</a>, and it contains each of their physical addresses, phone numbers, and fax numbers.</p>
<p>Immigration isn’t their focus, but agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation can also receive tips about suspected criminal activity. To send the FBI a tip, <a href="https://tips.fbi.gov/">go to this link</a> and fill out the contact form completely.</p>
<p>To place a phone call instead, you can reach the FBI’s headquarters at <a>202-324-3000</a>.</p>
<p>If you’d like to mail a letter, address it to: Federal Bureau of Investigation J. Edgar Hoover Building, 935 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, D.C. 20535-0001.</p>
<h4>I’m an employer and I think one of my employees is an illegal. Do I need to do anything?</h4>
<p>Yes. In fact, the law requires that you report it.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://smallbusiness.chron.com/report-illegal-immigrants-work-company-17452.html">a helpful article</a> on the subject for small business owners,</p>
<blockquote><p>United States employers who knowingly or unknowingly hire illegal immigrants in their place of business are subject to a variety of government sanctions, including both civil and criminal legal action. The Immigration and Nationality Act states that all U.S. employers must verify and document the identification of employees using the Employment Eligibility Form I-9. Failure to comply with these laws can result in government seizure of company assets as well as fines and possible forfeiture of the right of a company to bid on government contracts.</p>
<p>Steps for employers to take include:</p>
<p>1. Document evidence you have indicating an individual working for your company is an illegal immigrant. Documentation can include your suspicions or an overheard or direct conversation with the individual in question that relates to immigration status.</p>
<p>2. Make note of how long the employee has been working at the company. If you know the full name he is working under, document that as well.</p>
<p>3. Draft a letter that outlines the specifics of what you suspect. Include the name, address and phone number of your company, the name and title of the company owner and the name and title of the person responsible for hiring the individual in question, if known. Have the letter notarized and make a copy for your personal records.</p>
<p>4. Contact ICE. Upon receiving your report, work site enforcement investigations will explore not only the work status of the suspected illegal immigrant, but possible abuse by the employer, such as involvement in creating falsified documents, money laundering and threats of deportation.</p></blockquote>
<p>For more information on this program, <a href="https://www.ice.gov/worksite">go online to ICE Worksite Enforcement</a>. Use the ICE contact information above to report the suspected illegal immigrants.</p>
<h4>I’ve reported my suspicions. What do I do now?</h4>
<p>The new Trump Administration is still knee-deep undoing the damage that the Obama Administration did to immigration law enforcement. According to FAIR, Obama underfunded immigration enforcement, destroyed state-local enforcement agreements, and eliminated most immigration law enforcement within the nation’s interior. Further, as you all know, Obama and his progressive allies in states and cities across the country have given top cover to immigration law non-enforcement for political reasons.</p>
<p>That being said, if you report a suspected illegal immigrant and you don’t see any results right away (or ever), don’t despair. In the first place, the new administration is still changing the way that things are done. It may take a while for new orders to trickle down and take effect. Second, remember that <a href="https://www.amren.com/news/2016/11/how-trumps-plan-to-deport-criminal-illegal-aliens-would-work/">Trump said he’d deport illegals piecemeal</a> when he rolled out <a href="http://immigrationreform.com/2016/11/10/trump-unveils-10-point-immigration-priority-plan/">his 10-point immigration plan</a> last fall. Third, remember to be patient and pray. Rome wasn’t built in a day and America won’t be made great again in a day, either. Fourth, <a href="http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/">contact your Congressman</a> if he is friendly to the issue, and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/contact%23page">contact the White House</a>. The more shots we take, the higher our chances of success.</p>
<h4>Is there anything else I can do?</h4>
<p>If you’d like to help rid America of the scourge of illegal, mass migration firsthand, <a href="https://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/463429200/">Customs and Border Protection is hiring</a>. They are looking to place new officers along the nation’s southern and northern borders — from Maine, North Dakota, and Montana to Texas, Arizona, and California. The pay is pretty decent, so if you’re up for the challenge and willing to relocate to a border town, <a href="https://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/463429200/">check it out here</a>.</p>
