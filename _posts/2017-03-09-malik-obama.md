Malik Obama‏ is Barrack Obama's brother. Every time I see him post on Twitter I have to look it up again to be sure. Wikipedia has it plainly stated as true. A Quick Google search on Malik shows many recent (many Late 2016) news stories about Malik -- generally on the topic of his support for Donald Trump. Strange reality. You'd think more people would be paying attention to him.

_4 hours ago, Malik Obama posts a birth certificate on Twitter saying:_ 

> “Surely. What is this?” -  [@ObamaMalik](https://twitter.com/ObamaMalik)

It appears to be a birth certificate. Malik is sharing with the public what suggests that his brother Obama was not ever a citizen. Look at it. It shows Kenya as the place of birth. Does it not? 

Many of you are rolling your eyes of course. This has been gone over already you say. What does it matter you might even say.

Me? Well it's clear to me that either Malik is a Russian plant, or, Obama supporters are the colluders. Who are the real Russians here? Kenyans?
