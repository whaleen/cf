<p>I speak with some authority about the city of Houston. I was born here in 1950 (when it was a gracious southern city) and have lived here all of my life. David Brooks is a typical neocon idiot.</p>
<p><a href="https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19160601.2.25.12"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-108272" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vdare-live/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/01195711/polyglot.gif" alt="" width="225" align="right"></a>In the 1960s, and 70s Houston was dynamic and growing, but with a population that celebrated its Texas roots and history. Now it is what Theodore Roosevelt called a<a href="https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19160601.2.25.12"> “polyglot boarding house”</a> for the world.</p>
<p>This city has no spirit and is a multiculti nowhere land. Mr. Brook’s vibrant immigrants, including hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens, have rendered we Americans foreigners in our own land. The Houston school district schools (which I attended) are now dropout factories.</p><div id="57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4" class="vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539">    </div>
<p>The Third World school board voted to <a href="http://www.texasmonthly.com/the-daily-post/renaming-schools-named-confederates-take-hard-look-replacements/">strip</a> the names of Confederate heroes from schools that had born those names for over 80 years (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Long_Wisdom_High_School">including</a> my own <a href="http://houstonleealumni.org/lee/Welcome.html">Robert E. Lee High school</a>). Whole neighborhoods now have street signs in Chinese or Vietnamese.</p>
<p>Politically this demographic transformation has turned Harris County (in which Houston is located) into a liberal Democrat fiefdom. In the last election, while Texas as a whole went Republican, Harris county turned out of office every county wide Republican.</p>
<p>White Anglos have fled the city and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Houston">now comprise only 25 % of the population. </a>We have had a <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/houston-texas-no-freedom-of-speech-for-pastors-who-criticize-gays">Lesbian mayor</a> and now a <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/10/26/1587166/-Houston-DA-brings-up-opponent-s-sexual-orientation-in-desperate-appeal-to-right-wing-voters">Lesbian district attorney</a>. Brooks opinion that these people are “patriotic” is a sick joke. Mr. Brooks, you can keep your vibrant immigrants and I’ll remember what a great American city my hometown once was before you and people like you ruined it.</p>
