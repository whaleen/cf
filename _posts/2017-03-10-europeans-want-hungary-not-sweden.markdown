The cultural Marxist agenda by fake news outlets and the globalist political class would have us believe the West is filled with multiculturalists who have no longing for cultural preservation, no concern for how demographic change might affect the long-term stability of their country.  The data, however, are screaming the antithesis.  They're right, there is a subversive minority trying to spoil our countries but they are that minority!  The establishment holds up Sweden as a success, whereas Europeans secretly want Hungary; so, where do we go from here?
