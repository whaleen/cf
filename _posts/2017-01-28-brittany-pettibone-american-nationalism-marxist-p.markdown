She writes about and comments on politics, as well as a variety of social issues, and is the co-author of the science-fiction/fantasy novel, Hatred Day.
An audio version of this show is also available here.Our show begins with Brittany telling us about what it&rsquo;s like to be an identical twin. We learn about her upbringing, and how she ended up teaming up with her twin to write Hatred Day. Brittany then tells us about life in California, including its demographic transformation. We consider the increasingly popular Calexit proposition, and what its success would spell for the rest of the country. Switching gears, we talk about Brittany&rsquo;s trip to Trump&rsquo;s inauguration, which leads to a discussion on Trump&rsquo;s presidency thus far. Our show also covers Brittany&rsquo;s ideological journey, the future of the Democratic party, and the prevalence of political correctness and Cultural Marxism in the publishing industry.<div class="">
