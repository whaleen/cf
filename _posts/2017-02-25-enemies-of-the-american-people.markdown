<p>Donald Trump’s war on the media is a war of liberation to save America from the oligarchs who have held our people captive since at least the ‘60s. The same media organizations who began to scream hysterically as <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?424148-1/president-trump-holds-news-conference">Trump eviscerated them in public Feb. 16</a> are the ones who for 60 years have pushed every anti-American, anti-white, anti-Chri…</p>
<p>Oh, for time’s sake: These people are satanic.</p>
<p>Trump is doing the Lord’s work.</p>
<p>There is no risk that our constitutionally-protected rights to freedom of speech and freedom of the press will go away by virtue of a president’s verbal assault on propagandists who are, literally, <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/832708293516632065">“the enemies of the American people.”</a></p>
<p>(Who are the American people? Who does America belong to? <a href="http://faithandheritage.com/2011/01/who-does-america-belong-to/">Read more on that important definition here</a>.)</p>
<p>The First Amendment protects the freedom of the press by keeping the federal government out of its editorial board meetings. It keeps the press free by putting high barriers against governmental policies that interfere with the free dissemination of ideas and news. The purpose of the First Amendment protection of the freedom of the press, however, is not so that media companies may exist and do whatever they please.</p>
<p>The purpose of the freedom of the press is to preserve an educated, informed citizenry who have access to a diversity of opinions on matters affecting public policy. Why is that important? Because that itself is a means to an all-too-important end — one that Trump fully grasps and is fighting for.</p>
<p>The purpose of not only the freedom of the press, but also the First Amendment, the U.S. Constitution, and the very existence of an independent United States of America, is to preserve the right of the American people to exist, as themselves, free of foreign or domestic domination, and to perpetuate their race, their culture, their faith, forever.</p>
<p>Therefore, unless the federal government starts shutting down all the media companies that espouse a certain ideological or political line, we are nowhere near infringing upon the freedom of the press.</p>
<p>I want to make that clear for all those liberals out there who have misinterpreted Trump’s assault on the fake news media. But these are the same people who interpret conscientious objection to participating in a homosexual wedding ceremony as the legal equivalent of a criminal act of violence. I don’t really expect these snowflakes to ever get it. Sad!</p>
<p>And what also follows from this premise is that Trump is free to go after the media who have hijacked this country and made the American people their slaves. I’ll say that again: Trump, and the agents of the federal government, have the duty to go after whatever enemies — foreign and domestic — deny the American people their God-given right to exist, as themselves, and to ensure that their posterity may also enjoy the liberty and life that our forefathers struggled to provide for us.</p><div class="">
