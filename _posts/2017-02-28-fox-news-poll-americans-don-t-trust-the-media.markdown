It has been a while since we had a poll: “Some 44 percent have faith in the media. While that’s mostly unchanged since 2014, it’s a significant 19-point drop since 2002. A majority, 55 percent, lacks confidence today. Equal numbers of voters have no confidence at all in the media (36 percent) or the presidency (36 percent). Both are record highs. …” It has been that way since 2014 though. Nothing much has changed. Republicans have less confidence in the media. Democrats have more confidence in the media. Generally speaking, we inhabit our own bubbles now.<div class="">
