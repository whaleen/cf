<p><a id="xlink_1_3" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/#xlink_1_3" name="xlink_1_3"></a>… when I was asked by a academic journal to say if I were to hold the power for one day as president, what — and I would have kind of absolute power to introduce a law, what law that would have been? My immediate answer was not as some humanist suggested, since United States at least thinks they are a global empire, so let every adult in the world be allowed to vote; my advice would be the opposite one: let’s everybody in the world, except US citizens, be allowed to vote and elect the American government.</p></blockquote>
<p><a id="xlink_1_4" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/#xlink_1_4" name="xlink_1_4"></a>Old Slavoj does have kind of a point there about American elites’ reigning philosophy of Invade the World / Invite the World.</p>
<p><a id="xlink_1_5" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/#xlink_1_5" name="xlink_1_5"></a>One long run consequence of the government electing a new people will be the new people eventually electing new elites or in some other, perhaps undemocratic, fashion getting rid of the current elites.</p>
