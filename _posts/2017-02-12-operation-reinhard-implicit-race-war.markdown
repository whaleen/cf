<img align="left" hspace="12" alt="Operation Reinhard - Implicit Race War" src="https://rdice.net/a/c/t/17/OR-Implicit-Race-War.9cd7b47f.jpg"> America is fracturing along implicitly racial lines. Contrary to what mainstream conservatives and liberals might say, Trump is not the cause of this division; he merely brought this simmering conflict to the surface. By daring to tell the truth about immigration, globalism, and multiculturalism, he gave a voice to White America &ndash; a demographic that, prior to his arrival, was seemingly content to go quietly into the night.
This is an excerpt from episode 27&nbsp;of Weekend Warrior, a live show available to Red Ice Members.
