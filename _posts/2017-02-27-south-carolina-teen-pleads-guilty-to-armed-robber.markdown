<p>A teenager dubbed ‘prune head’ for his scalp’s appearance was jailed for up to five years after he robbed a child’s motel birthday party with a gun.</p>
<p>Rufus Gates, 17, was sentenced to prison for barging into a child’s birthday party and robbing someone at gunpoint at a motel in Santee, South Carolina.</p>
<p>He pleaded guilty to the December 2015 robbery where he was assisted by Alexander Lamar Outlaw, who was earlier sentenced to ten years in prison.</p>
<p>The teenager has been teased online over his mugshot, where social media users called him a ‘prune head’ because of the wavy lines of skin on his scalp.</p>
<p>Gates was arrested shortly after the armed robbery at the Delta Motel, located in central South Carolina, reported WITN.</p>
<p>The two men had entered the room where there were four children and two adults and pushed everyone into a corner and demanded a man hand over his property.</p>
<p>The robbery happened at the Delta Motel (pictured) in Santee, South Carolina, in December of 2015. There were four children and two adults in the room at the time of the robbery</p>
<p>After Gates’ mugshot was released by news outlets, his head’s appearance has been made the subject of several prune and raisin jokes.</p>
<p>The top of Gates’ scalp is indented by rolls of skin that are bunched up to make it appear as if it is wrinkled, much like a raisin, a prune or the surface of a brain.</p>
