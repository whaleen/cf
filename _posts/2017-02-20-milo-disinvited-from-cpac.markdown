As I expected, we have more MILO and CPAC news: &#34;@ACUConservative has decided to rescind the invitation of Milo Yiannopoulos to speak at #CPAC2017.&#34; pic.twitter.com/sVWGnPCW7C &#8212; Matt Schlapp (@mschlapp) February 20, 2017 Who could have ever predicted that? I assumed the Dangerous Faggot would be disinvited by sundown. He was out before noon. It caps the quickest rise and fall since the Hindenburg.<div class="">
