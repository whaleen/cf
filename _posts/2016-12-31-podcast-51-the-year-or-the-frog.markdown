Colin and Andy are joined by Alt-Right stalwarts Richard Wolstencroft and Alex Fontana to take a long look back at the "Current Year" that will soon be no more. Among many topics discussed are Bowie, Brexit, Trump, the Alt-Right, and the nature of Capitalism. Will Trump live up to the hopes placed in him, or will he disappoint? All this and more in the final Alt-Right podcast of 2016, a remarkable and revolutionary year. Onward and upwards to 2017!<div class="">
