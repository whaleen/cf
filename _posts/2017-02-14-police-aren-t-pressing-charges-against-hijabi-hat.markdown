   &lt;div class=&quot;pf-content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cops &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/31188/&quot;&gt;aren’t pressing charges&lt;/a&gt; against the Muslima who fabricated a hate crime in telling police that a white man (described as such in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2016/11/13/university-of-michigan-student-wearing-a-hijab-threatened-to-be-lit-on-fire-police-say/?utm_term=.34a57d12b162&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) threatened to burn her if she did not remove her hijab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4&quot; class=&quot;vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539&quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campus SJW’s protested of course. About nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it doesn’t really matter that she lied. The “larger truth” is what matters.&lt;/p&gt;
