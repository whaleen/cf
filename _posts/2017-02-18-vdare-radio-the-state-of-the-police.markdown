<p>I’m Virginia Dare and you’re listening to Radio VDARE.</p>
<p>Police officers are always in a difficult spot politically. On the one hand, they are the ones most at risk when their superiors impose misguided policies. We see the cost in the increased attacks on law enforcement officers in cities all around the country. Perhaps better than anyone, police officers see, and have to deal with, the real world impact of illegal immigration or the so-called Black Lives Matter movement. And though police unions endorse certain candidates, police officers really aren’t supposed to talk about their political views.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the role of police is always at least somewhat political. Like bureaucrats, police officers have a certain amount of power in determining which laws or rules they want to enforce energetically. More importantly, at the higher levels, those in charge of police departments are undoubtedly political figures. A police chief’s admission that crime is rising or that a policy isn’t working can bring down a mayor. A police chief’s own political survival is also dependent on showing crime continuously declining.</p>
<p>Thus, you often get a division between the cops walking the beat and the higher ups looking to defend their political connections and their own careers. We regularly get messages from police officers in cities like Chicago complaining that their bosses are not letting them drop the hammer on crime or that they are actively being sabotaged. Blogs like <a href="http://secondcitycop.blogspot.com/">Second City Cop</a> are essential reading for finding out what is really happening on the streets. Not surprisingly, those who want to control the public debate are often eager to censor such publications.</p>
<p>Now, in Sweden, we have another huge controversy. A Swedish police officer made <a href="https://www.facebook.com/peter.springare/posts/10208300682343230?pnref=story">a Facebook post</a> which has led to an internal investigation and a complaint by the police management about “racial agitation.” The officer’s crime? He pointed out how uncontrolled Third World immigration has practically destroyed Sweden.</p>
<p>He wrote:</p>
<p>“Our pensioners are on their knees, the schools are a mess, healthcare an inferno… we all know why.”</p>
<p>The officer claimed almost every crime he handles has a non-European perpetrator. He claimed: “Countries representing the weekly all crimes: Iraq, Iraq, Turkey, Syria, Afghanistan, Somalia, Somalia, Syria again, Somalia, unknown, unknown country, Sweden. Half of the suspects, we can&#8217;t be sure because they don&#8217;t have any valid papers. Which in itself usually means that they&#8217;re lying about your nationality and identity.”</p><!-- TAG START { player: "7518-804336-VDare - Outstream - Rev", owner: "ONE Video by AOL", for: "ONE Video by AOL" - BEINJS } --><div id="57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4" class="vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539">    <script type="text/javascript" src="//delivery.vidible.tv/jsonp/pid=57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4/56bcd17ce4b018167fea5539_bein.js"></script></div><!-- TAG END { date: 07/25/16 } -->
<p>The Prime Minister of the country has even <a href="http://www.thelocal.se/20170208/swedish-police-officer-causes-controversy-with-facebook-post?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">challenged</a> the officer’s claims, saying immigrants can’t possibly take up so much of the attention and resources of the police. He also said the officer is entitled to his views because Sweden has free speech.</p>
<p>This, of course, is a lie. Sweden, and other European nations like France and Germany, does not have free speech. And police have openly admitted they occasionally <a href="http://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/01/its-not-only-germany-that-covers-up-mass-sex-attacks-by-migrant-men-swedens-record-is-shameful/">cover up crimes</a> because they do not want to, quote, “play into the hands of the Sweden Democrats,” what passes for a patriotic party in that country. Thus, rape, sexual assault, and the emergence of lawless zones throughout the country are seen as less bad than making comments which might make Swedes more likely to vote for a party which will restrict immigration.</p>
<p>And the costs for Sweden have been horrific. In one Swedish town, law enforcement is <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/european-women-face-the-end-of-safe-streets-because-muslim-immigration">simply telling</a> Swedish women to stay home because they can’t (or won’t) protect them from roaming gangs of foreign men. Locals <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/how-safe-low-crime-sweden-was-sacrificed-to-the-god-of-diversity">give tearful testimonies</a> about how once peaceful towns and villages have been utterly destroyed. But not too loudly – you don’t want to get arrested for “hate speech.” And if you do complain about Muslim migrants, even if you are objectively correct, you might still be convicted. <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/swedish-judge-on-criticism-of-muslim-rape-wave-whether-or-not-a-pronouncement-is-true-has-no-bearing-on-the-case">As one judge put it</a>, whether or not a pronouncement is true “has no bearing on the case.”</p>
<p>This conspiracy of silence is breaking down. The latest incident was a <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/02/08/alleged-gang-rape-facebook-shocks-sweden/97633012/">live broadcast</a> on Facebook of a gang rape of a Swedish woman by three foreign men. And now with police officers speaking out, perhaps the long deception will finally be exposed.</p>
<p>We’d best hope so. If things continue as they have been, Sweden will be Northern Europe’s first failed state. And a permanent warning to the world about the costs of uncontrolled immigration.</p>
<p>I’m Virginia Dare and we will speak again soon.</p>
