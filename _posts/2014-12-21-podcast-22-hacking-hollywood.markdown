   Computer expert and Alt-Right contributor Matt Parrott joins Andy and Colin to talk about the Sony Pictures hack that has temporarily lifted the lid on a major Hollywood studio. They speculate on who is behind the hack – German teenagers or an enraged Kim Jong-un – how much dirt the hackers have yet to release, and whether the movie at the center of the story, &quot;The Interview&quot; – a crass depiction of the assassination of one of America&#39;s enemies – will eventually become a long-running and highly successful franchise. Also on the menu is the moral entropy of the West and how Alt-Righters can protect themselves from suffering the same fate as Sony Pictures.           # => "I’ve been hurting to write this ever since we had the idea of creating a Planet for Cubox..."
