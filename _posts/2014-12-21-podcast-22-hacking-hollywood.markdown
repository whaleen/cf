Computer expert and Alt-Right contributor Matt Parrott joins Andy and Colin to talk about the Sony Pictures hack that has temporarily lifted the lid on a major Hollywood studio. They speculate on who is behind the hack – German teenagers or an enraged Kim Jong-un – how much dirt the hackers have yet to release, and whether the movie at the center of the story, "The Interview" – a crass depiction of the assassination of one of America's enemies – will eventually become a long-running and highly successful franchise. Also on the menu is the moral entropy of the West and how Alt-Righters can protect themselves from suffering the same fate as Sony Pictures.<div class="">
