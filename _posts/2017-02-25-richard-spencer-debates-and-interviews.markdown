I graduated from Auburn University in 2005. For years, I lived across the street from the Ludwig von Mises Institute, which is a major libertarian think tank. There was a time in the early 2000s when libertarianism was cool. I used to read LewRockwell.com on a daily basis. When the Alt-Right first began to coalesce around 2008, we included paleoconservatives and libertarians in the big tent along with the White Nationalists. If you were “Alternative Right,” it meant you were not a George W. Bush supporting mainstream conservative. Instead, it meant you were reading a bunch of rightwing sites like Liberty Forum, VDARE, Lew Rockwell.com, Antiwar.com, Takimag, American Renaissance, etc. You were constructing, participating in and consuming a discourse of unorthodox rightwing ideas. When I first discovered Richard Spencer, it seemed like everyone at Takimag was backing the Ron Paul presidential campaign. A ton of people who were Alt-Right or White Nationalists voted for and supported Ron Paul. As libertarianism began to go mainstream though, it was infiltrated and subverted. It became less edgy and cool. To be honest, it became kind of lame after 2012 or so. Jack Hunter aka the “Southern Avenger” symbolizes everything that went wrong with libertarianism. Jeffrey Tucker is another example of how libertarianism lost its edge. Libertarianism became politically correct. It was a losing strategy and it came to a head in 2016 when the Alt-Right united behind President Trump and left Rand Paul’s flailing campaign in the dust. Shortly thereafter, it was revealed that the populists and nationalists who had supported Ron Paul in 2008 and 2012, but who had abandoned Rand Paul, were a pretty large constituency. Anyway, I agree with Julie Borowski and would love to see a libertarian step up and debate Richard Spencer. Note: If you are Alt-Right, you are accustomed to thinking in terms of interests, not abstract principles. This is a point that Mike Enoch make in his interview with Thomas Main. When we look at President Trump, we see someone who is advancing our interests. In contrast, a libertarian who is naive enough to believe that “politics” can magically go away would be more interested in, say, grandstanding over his “principles.” Libertarians are notorious for allowing the Left to win by a making a fetish out of universal abstractions. Little Jeffrey says that libertarian is an “anti-fascist” movement. In the 1990s, Little Jeffrey was pretending to be a populist with the Rothbard-Rockwell strategy in the Ron Paul Newsletters. Since then, he has transitioned from a right-libertarian into a left-libertarian and is on the verge of becoming a full blown SJW-libertarian. At a recent conference, Tuckleypuff started wrist flapping and called the cops to have the state remove Spencer the hotel. Richard Spencer debates Diante Johnson at CPAC. In the debate, he makes the point that we are conservatives in the European sense of the term. We believe in conserving actual things: our people, our culture, our peculiar way of life, etc. In contrast, American conservatives believe in classical liberalism and a number of other unrelated things.<div class="">
