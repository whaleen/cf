<div class="pf-content"><p><span style="color: #993300;">[<em>Adapted from the latest Radio Derb, now available <a href="http://www.vdare.com/radios">exclusively </a>on VDARE.com.</em>]</span></p>
<p>The Fake News story of the week also offered insights into just how insulated from reality our <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/john-derbyshire-cecil-the-lion-and-the-goodwhite-badwhite-cold-civil-war">Goodwhites </a>are. It started with President Trump telling <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/19/world/europe/last-night-in-sweden-trumps-remark-baffles-a-nation.html">a rally in Florida</a> last Saturday that:</p>
<blockquote><p> You look at what&#8217;s happening in Germany. You look at what&#8217;s happening last night in Sweden. Sweden! —Who would believe this? Sweden! They took in large numbers. They&#8217;re having problems like they never thought possible …</p>

<p>The problem here: The President is a careless speaker, with a loose grasp of sentence structure and syntax.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mind this, personally. There are many worse things a President might be: He might be an <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/i-told-you-so-obama-is-the-ultimate-affirmative-action-case">Affirmative-Action</a> mediocrity <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/mama-obama-a-stuff-white-people-like-hall-of-famer">obsessed</a> with <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/president-obama-talks-about-pssy-while-speaking-in-what-harry-reid-called-negro-dialect">proving</a> how <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/the-double-standard-on-the-is-obama-black-enough-question">black</a> he is, or he might be an <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/bush-signs-us-up-for-global-democratic-revolution">evangelical romantic</a> with a <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/ideology-was-bushs-undoing">mission</a> to convert the <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/despite-bush-dogma-mideast-democracy-means-more-islamism">Heathen</a> to <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/what-if-a-democratic-iraq-doesnt-like-us">Jeffersonian democracy</a>, or he might be a <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/kristol-scores-trump-for-having-associated-with-bill-clinton-rapist-but-kristol-is-trying-to-put-clinton-back-in-the-white-house">slick sociopath</a> who <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/trump-vs-the-clintons-who-has-actually-been-abusing-women">boffs interns</a> across the desk in the <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/ann-coulter-hillary-is-not-a-victim-of-bills-sex-crimes-shes-an-accomplice">Oval Office,</a> or … Well, you get the idea. Poor speaking skills are not, for me, a deal-breaker.</p>
<p>This weakness sure does leave the President open to his enemies, though. Announcing his <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/trump-announces-run-for-president-slammed-by-thinkprogress-for-mentioning-immigration">candidacy </a>a year and a half ago, he <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/08/donald-trumps-false-comments-connecting-mexican-immigrants-and-crime/?utm_term=.d6c0b45d08e7">famously</a> observed that</p>
<blockquote><p>When Mexico sends its people, they&#8217;re not <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/trump-announces-run-for-president-slammed-by-thinkprogress-for-mentioning-immigration">sending </a>their best. They&#8217;re not sending you. They&#8217;re not sending you. They&#8217;re sending<a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/ann-coulter-media-furious-trump-breaks-embargo-with-hatefacts-about-mexicans"> people that have lots of problems,</a> and they&#8217;re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/of-cantaloupes-and-criminals-nyt-and-treason-lobby-still-targeting-steve-king">drugs</a>. They’re <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/mulshine-morristown-and-mara-salvatrucha">bringing crime.</a> They’re <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/support-your-local-hispanic-rapist">rapists</a>.. And some, I assume, are good people.[Links added]</p>

<p><iframe src="//www.washingtonpost.com/video/c/embed/38fe4482-144d-11e5-8457-4b431bf7ed4c" width="480" height="290" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>There are at least three lapses of sense in that, which is a lot to get into 48 words. That &#8220;with us,&#8221; for example, in the fourth sentence, should be <em>either</em> &#8220;to us&#8221; or &#8220;with them.&#8221; &#8220;They&#8217;re bringing those problems with us&#8221; makes no sense.</p>
<p>And then, &#8220;they&#8217;re rapists.&#8221; It always gets printed in the media as t-h-e-y-apostrophe-r-e &#8220;they&#8217;re.&#8221; It could just as easily be t-h-e-i-r &#8220;their,&#8221; keying to &#8220;their best&#8221; in the first sentence.</p>
<p>That actually makes better sense. If he meant &#8220;they are rapists,&#8221; what was he doing in the next sentence saying that some of them are good people?</p>
<p>My best guess: Trump&#8217;s brain got the two meanings of [ðɛə] tangled in his mind because of their occurrence close together in his first sentence, &#8220;they&#8217;re not sending their best.&#8221; I&#8217;ve caught myself hitting the same speed bump occasionally—a lot <em>more</em> than occasionally when trying to speak foreign languages.</p>
<p>So the President&#8217;s underlying idea was: &#8220;They are not sending their best, they are sending their rapists.&#8221;</p>
<p>See, there might be only seven rapists in all of Mexico, but those are the kinds of people we&#8217;re getting: their rapists, t-h-e-i-r. I seriously doubt the President believed that <em>all</em> Mexicans are rapists, or even all illegal immigrant Mexicans. That would be nuts; and you don&#8217;t have a business career as successful as his if you&#8217;re nuts.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s y-o-u-apostrophe-r-e &#8220;you&#8217;re,&#8221; not y-o-u-r &#8220;your,&#8221; y-o-r-e &#8220;yore,&#8221; or y-a-w &#8220;yaw.&#8221;</p>
<p>Language is a minefield, and English is by no means the worst case. <a href="http://www.vdare.com/radios/radio-derb-february-17th">Last week </a>I signed out Radio Derb with a <a href="https://youtu.be/mlGoHi055ig">pop song in Cantonese</a>, a language in which any syllable can be pronounced in seven different tones, each with a different meaning. Let&#8217;s give thanks our President doesn&#8217;t have to address us in Cantonese.</p>
<p>These homophones—&#8221;there/their/they&#8217;re,&#8221; &#8220;your/you&#8217;re,&#8221;—are in fact massively confused by <em>writers</em> of English. Read a few comment threads, even at august outlets like the <em>New York Times</em>. It&#8217;s plain that half the population, or at any rate half the comment-posting population, can&#8217;t distinguish between y-o-u-apostrophe-r-e &#8220;you&#8217;re&#8221; and y-o-u-r &#8220;your.&#8221; How that half of the population breaks down by voting preferences, I&#8217;ll leave to the psephologists to research.</p>
<p>So, forward to last Saturday and the President saying that, &#8220;You look at what&#8217;s happening last night in Sweden.&#8221; It happened that Tucker Carlson over at Fox News, which the President is known to watch, had done a segment the evening before about crime among Muslim immigrants in Sweden. Plainly the President meant to say: &#8220;You look at what&#8217;s happening in Sweden, as I saw last night.&#8221; That sentence is syntactically more complex, though, so his mind fed his tongue something simpler.</p>
<p>It can happen to anybody. I&#8217;ve had embarrassing experiences, and so have you.</p>
<p>When it happens to a politician who is <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/are-attacks-on-trump-a-textbook-example-of-coordination">loathed </a>by a ninety-five-percent-hostile Main Stream Media, though—a media who are relentlessly vigilant for the<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/02/16/trump-asks-a-black-reporter-to-set-up-a-meeting-with-black-members-of-congress/?utm_term=.0e42e9546ca8"> tiniest infractions</a> on the President&#8217;s part&#8211;we have a news story.</p>
<p>The real news story here, it seems to me, is what a bubble our media elites live in.</p><!-- TAG START { player: "7518-804336-VDare - Outstream - Rev", owner: "ONE Video by AOL", for: "ONE Video by AOL" - BEINJS } --><div id="57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4" class="vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539">    <script type="text/javascript" src="//delivery.vidible.tv/jsonp/pid=57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4/56bcd17ce4b018167fea5539_bein.js"></script></div><!-- TAG END { date: 07/25/16 } -->
<p>I don&#8217;t have a column in a broadsheet newspaper, or a <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/steven-colbert-and-the-rise-and-coming-fall-of-the-white-minstrel-show">smirk-o-rama TV show</a> to whip up blue-state metrosexuals into gales of laughter against <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/duck-dynasty-and-the-new-blacklist">redneck hillbilly Badwhites. </a>I&#8217;m just a guy who browses the internet every morning looking for interesting news stories to pass comment on. Still I&#8217;ve been <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/malm-a-case-study-in-multiculturalism">aware </a>for <em>years</em> of the <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/sweden-asylum-seeking-somali-is-charged-in-murder-of-social-worker">horrible disaster </a>that mass Muslim immigration has brought to Sweden.</p>
<p>Why wouldn&#8217;t I be? It&#8217;s been all over<a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/make-europe-great-again-nationalism-on-the-rise-but-fast-enough"> the European papers,</a> and they&#8217;re all on the internet. For <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/huge-immigrant-riots-break-out-in-perfectly-safe-sweden"><em>years</em></a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not just talking about<a href="https://www.google.com/search?sclient=psy-ab&amp;btnG=Search&amp;q=site%3Adailymail.co.uk+sweden+crime+"> garish populist tabloids,</a> either. In thirty seconds of searching I found this story from the London <em>Guardian</em>, which is a serious heavyweight newspaper with an editorial line to the <em>left</em> of <a href="http://www.historyinanhour.com/2013/06/30/walter-ulbricht-summary/">Walter Ulbricht</a>. Date: May 23rd, 2013—al<a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/muslim-rioting-in-sweden-as-seen-by-the-goodthinkers-of-the-la-times">most four years ago</a>. Headline: <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/23/swedish-riots-stockholm">Swedish Riots Rage For Fourth Night</a></em> Opener:</p>
<blockquote><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-108011" title="" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vdare-live/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/25220205/2013.png" width="225" height="190" align="right" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vdare-live/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/25220205/2013.png 893w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vdare-live/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/25220205/2013-150x127.png 150w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vdare-live/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/25220205/2013-300x253.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vdare-live/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/25220205/2013-768x648.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vdare-live/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/25220205/2013-441x372.png 441w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />Hundreds of youths burnt down a restaurant, set fire to more than 30 cars and attacked police during a fourth night of rioting in the suburbs of Stockholm, shocking a country that dodged the worst of the financial crisis but failed to solve youth unemployment and resentment among asylum seekers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, it&#8217;s all &#8220;youths&#8221; and &#8220;teens&#8221; in the first few paragraphs. This is a broadsheet newspaper, though, so eventually they have to name names. The first person they name, other than a police spokesperson in paragraph five, is one Selcuk Ceken in paragraph six. That&#8217;s a Turkish name, not a Swedish one. The next is Rami Al-khamisi in paragraph nine.</p>
<p>Mr. Al-Khamisi tells the <em>Guardian</em> that the problem is, wait for it…&#8221;institutional racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, maybe it is and maybe it isn&#8217;t. One thing, however, is surely beyond dispute: No amount of &#8220;institutional racism&#8221; would have <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2013/may/24/world/la-fg-wn-sweden-riots-20130524">led to riots </a>and the burning of restaurants in Sweden if the Swedes hadn&#8217;t been such damn fools as to open their borders to hundreds of thousands of unassimilable Third Worlders.</p>
<p>Those 2013 riots weren&#8217;t a one-off, either. Rioting Muslims are a regular feature of Swedish life nowadays.(In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%E2%80%9309_Oslo_riots">2008</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Rinkeby_riots">2010</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Stockholm_riots">2013</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_unrest_in_Norrk%C3%B6ping_and_Borl%C3%A4nge">2016&#8211;</a>not an exhaustive list.) I read the newspapers, including the European ones, every day. I could have told the American media folk about it, if they&#8217;d asked.</p>
<p>Or they could have tried reading the papers themselves…No, I guess that would be too much to expect.</p>
<p>In fact, there was another Muslim riot last weekend, even as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/feb/21/late-night-tv-roundup-trump-sweden-never-fjorget">TV smirkers were smirking at how dumb our President is.</a> I&#8217;d like to tell you that <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/stephen-colbert-mocks-president-trump-swedish-terror-remark-article-1.2977808">Steven Colbert</a> and crew were embarrassed; but these guys don&#8217;t embarrass easy. They just ignored the riot. See, if our media elites don&#8217;t talk about something, it didn&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-95490" title="" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vdare-live/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/31190803/believenothing-576x1024.png" alt="believenothing" width="225" height="400" align="right" srcset="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vdare-live/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/31190803/believenothing-576x1024.png 576w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vdare-live/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/31190803/believenothing-84x150.png 84w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vdare-live/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/31190803/believenothing-169x300.png 169w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vdare-live/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/31190803/believenothing-768x1365.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vdare-live/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/31190803/believenothing-209x372.png 209w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vdare-live/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/31190803/believenothing-1038x1845.png 1038w, https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/vdare-live/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/31190803/believenothing.png 1242w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />Going back to the President&#8217;s speech issues at last, my suggestion to him would be to play the victim card. He should start putting it out that he&#8217;s suffered from dyslexia since childhood. Then our media watchdogs are guilty of what is apparently called “ableism,” making fun of a disabled person [<em>klaxon alarm</em>], just as they have <a href="https://www.catholics4trump.com/the-true-story-donald-trump-did-not-mock-a-reporters-disability/">accused </a>Trump of doing—<a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/ann-coulter-media-invented-lie-about-trump-mocking-disabled-washington-post-reporter">falsely, of course</a>.</p>
<p><em>That</em> should get Meryl Streep choked up at the next awards ceremony.<br />
