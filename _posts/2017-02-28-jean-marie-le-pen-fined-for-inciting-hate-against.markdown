<p>The father of French far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen has been ordered to pay 5,000 euros ($5,300) after describing people from the Roma minority as smelly.</p>
<p>An appeals court on Monday in the southern city of Aix-en-Provence found Jean-Marie Le Pen, the 88-year-old founder of the National Front (FN) party, guilty of inciting hate and making racist and negationist statements with the comments at a press conference in Nice in 2013.</p>
<p>Le Pen said at the time: “It appears you have a problem with several hundred Roma who have an irritating and, let’s say, smelly presence in this city.”</p>
<p>It was the ninth time that Le Pen, who infamously repeatedly referred to the Holocaust as a “detail of history”, has been convicted of such offences.</p>
<p>“I stick by these terms because it is what I think,” Le Pen said at an earlier hearing.</p>
<p>“Jean-Marie Le Pen’s words were extremely serious and an open call to hate and ethnic discrimination,” said Sonny Phung of the anti-racism group SOS Racisme, which will receive around $2,100 of Le Pen’s fine.</p>
<p>The Roma minority largely come from <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/bulgaria.html">Bulgaria</a> and Romania and are often stigmatised in <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/france.html">France</a> where they have been accused of being responsible for a rise in petty crime.</p>
<p>Le Pen was the runner-up in the 2002 presidential <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/events/election.html">election</a> that rocked the French political establishment.</p>
<p>In recent years, he has had a public falling out with his daughter after she took over the reins of the party and has sought to purge it of its more controversial elements.</p>
<p>Marine Le Pen is currently forecast to win the first round of France’s presidential election on April 23, but lose the all-important May 7 runoff to either centrist Emmanuel Macron or conservative Francois Fillon.</p>
<p>However, polls show she has significantly reduced the projected margin of defeat in the past two months.</p>
