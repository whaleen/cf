<p><em>(Excerpted with permission from Dr. Woods’s daily email.)</em></p>
<p>Sure enough, a YouGov poll taken in late 2016 confirmed my suspicion.</p>
<p>Some 42% of millennials have no idea who Mao Tse-Tung was. For comparison, I&#8217;m pretty sure they all know who Hitler was. Somehow Mao never hit their radar screens.</p>
<p>Ever heard of V.I. Lenin? One-third of millennials haven&#8217;t.</p>
<p><em><strong><a href="http://www.cmi-gold-silver.com/article/dangers-of-buying-gold/?utm_source=LRC&amp;utm_medium=textad&amp;utm_campaign=advertisedgold">Why are the most advertised Gold and Silver coins NOT the best way to invest?</a></strong></em></p>
<p>Of those who have, one in four view him favorably. Arbitrary arrests and killings, some 50,000 people in concentration camps, one-party rule, and a reign of terror &#8212; what&#8217;s not to like?</p>
<p>If a poll showed one in four kiddos viewing Hitler favorably, I&#8217;m pretty sure it would be all over the news.</p>
<p>No surprise that 37% view Che Guevara favorably, but even truly mass murderers got some love, with 18% favorability for Mao and even 12% for Stalin.</p>
<p>One out of eight kids who knows who Stalin is thinks he&#8217;s A-OK.</p>
<p>Of course, if they&#8217;d taken the <a href="http://TomWoodsHomeschool.com/western-civilization-from-1493/">Western Civilization</a> from 1493 course I prepared for the Ron Paul Curriculum, they&#8217;d be in better shape.</p>
<p>(This course is also included as a bonus with the master membership at my<a href="http://tomwoods.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=77713d21ff56f1c126607d2c5&amp;id=a6fc1f9062&amp;e=82e158f26a"><strong>LibertyClassroom.com</strong></a>.)</p>
<p>Down with commies.</p>
