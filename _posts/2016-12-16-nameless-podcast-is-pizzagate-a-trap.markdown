In his latest "Nameless" podcast, Andy Nowicki considers the proposition that #Pizzagate may be a trap, designed to ensnare alternative media members and online researchers into charges of harassment and unwitting "fake news" circulation, and thus into the snares of online censorship at the hands of the the corrupt and complicitous media establishment.

Andy holds that, when examined properly and pursued conscientiously, #Pizzagate is in fact no trap, but rather an opening by which more and more people may be enabled to know that our would-be rulers have altogether forfeited their right to exercise any sort of control over the rest of us (if indeed one doesn't decline to concede that they were ever in possession of this right in the first place!).<div class="">
