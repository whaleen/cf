   In his latest &quot;Nameless&quot; podcast, Andy Nowicki considers the proposition that #Pizzagate may be a trap, designed to ensnare alternative media members and online researchers into charges of harassment and unwitting &quot;fake news&quot; circulation, and thus into the snares of online censorship at the hands of the the corrupt and complicitous media establishment.

Andy holds that, when examined properly and pursued conscientiously, #Pizzagate is in fact no trap, but rather an opening by which more and more people may be enabled to know that our would-be rulers have altogether forfeited their right to exercise any sort of control over the rest of us (if indeed one doesn&#39;t decline to concede that they were ever in possession of this right in the first place!).           # => "Iâ€™ve been hurting to write this ever since we had the idea of creating a Planet for Cubox..." (Continued)
