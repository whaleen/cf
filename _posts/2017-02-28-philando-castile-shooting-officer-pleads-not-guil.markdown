<p>The police officer accused of fatally shooting Philando Castile has pleaded not guilty in a Minnesota court. Castile’s death in July 2016 caused mass protests when the aftermath was streamed on Facebook Live by Castille’s girlfriend.</p>
<p>Jeronimo Yanez (28), who is currently on leave from the St Anthony Police Department, is charged with manslaughter with a trial date set for May 30. His attorney told the court on Monday that he will request the trial be moved from St Paul, which is just a few miles from Falcon Heights where Castile (32) was shot, reported the <a href="http://www.startribune.com/officer-pleads-not-guilty-in-castile-shooting-death/414873584/">Minneapolis Star Tribune</a>.</p>
<p>Prosecutors claim Yanez acted unreasonably when he shot Castile seven times while sitting in the passenger seat of a car at a traffic stop. His girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, began streaming the aftermath on Facebook Live, showing the bloodied Castile and his upset four-year-old daughter in the back seat.</p>
<p>The video quickly gained nationwide attention and received accusations of police brutality, sparking mass protests.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Yanez’s attorneys attempted to have the case dropped, claiming Castile put himself at risk by allegedly consuming marijuana and disobeying police orders. The request was denied, however.</p>
<p>The shooting of Castile came just one day after the death of African-American Alton Sterling while pinned to the ground by police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, sparking a period of civil unrest in a number of areas of the US.</p>
