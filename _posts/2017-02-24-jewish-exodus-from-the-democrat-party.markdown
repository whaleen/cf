Since 1992, between 69% to 80% of Jews have voted Democrat. But that might all be changing now thanks to the changing nature of the Party. <br /><br />Following its crushing defeat in the 2016 Presidential election, the Democratic Party is going through a radical change that is pushing it in an even more leftist direction that is proving extremely awkward for its ruling cliques of SWPLs and secular Jews. <br /><br /><a name='more'></a>The current campaign for the Chair of the Democratic National Committee, the most important position in the Party when it is out of government, has thrown up the strong possibility of Keith Ellison, a Black Muslim (actually more than 50% White), being elected. Ellison is now widely regarded as the favourite.<br /><br />With the Dems increasingly dependent on the "ethnic" vote, SWPLs in the Party have had to go along with so-called attacks on their "White privilege," while Jews in the Party have had to increasingly distance themselves from the state of Israel, which Leftists see as the last European colony.<br /><br />Ellison's rise in the Party is the natural outcome of these tendencies. In the past he has been associated with Louis Farrakhan (another <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=High%20Yella%20(High%20Yellow)" target="_blank">"hi' yella"</a> Black man) and his Nation of Islam, an organization which has been described as "Anti-Semitic" (a term that admittedly ranges from GTKRWN to not fully supporting the state of Israel's West Bank settler policy).<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-n8E4Qk3f1VI/WK_MFKQ5TKI/AAAAAAAAVt8/mvPHn232Q0YqY0EvsNlWoBsKUec0RUUXwCLcB/s1600/ellison-farrakhan-600-x-309.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="281" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-n8E4Qk3f1VI/WK_MFKQ5TKI/AAAAAAAAVt8/mvPHn232Q0YqY0EvsNlWoBsKUec0RUUXwCLcB/s400/ellison-farrakhan-600-x-309.jpg" width="550" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: large;"><i>Ellison and "mentor" Farrakhan</i></span></td></tr></tbody></table>Ellison's declared position on Israel is actually fairly reasonable. In a widely reported <a href="http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/218884/keith-ellison-allegedly-said-u-s-foreign-policy-is-governed-by-israel" target="_blank">2010 speech</a> he said:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">"The United States foreign policy in the Middle East is governed by what is good or bad through a country of 7 million people. A region of 350 million all turns on a country of 7 million. Does that make sense? Is that logic? Right? When the Americans who trace their roots back to those 350 million get involved, everything changes. Can I say that again?"</span></blockquote>But, of course, this is not good enough for many American secular Jews, for whom Israel is of paramount importance and a place to which they have, in a sense, "outsourced their identity" to. But there is no reason why anyone else in the Democratic alliance should care about it, <i>especially when being pro-Muslim is the new way to demonstrate how anti-Trump one is.</i><br /><br />As the Democrat Party moves in this direction, Jews are feeling increasingly uncomfortable—including all the dumb Neocons, who jumped on board with Hillary in a desperate attempt to stop Trump. It is also causing concern among Israelis.<br /><br />Israel's Justice Minister, Ayelet Shaked, speaking at the <a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20170220-minister-i-am-concerned-about-decreasing-us-support-for-israel/#.WKsXQst0cf9.facebook" target="_blank">Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organisations</a> on Monday (20th Feb), said:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">"I am concerned about...decreasing support for Israel in the Democratic Party. I almost didn’t sleep at night after I saw a poll two weeks ago."</span></blockquote><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/01/12/democrats-are-suddenly-very-worried-about-russia-and-view-palestinians-on-par-with-israel/?utm_term=.dfaf9331c24c" target="_blank">That poll</a> showed dropping support for Israel among Democrats and rising support for Palestinians.<br /><br />With the Democrats turning into an "anti-Semitic" party, how much longer will Jews continue to support them, and can the Democrats survive without all those Jewish donations?<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-01FORKQQExA/WK_MN0nVeII/AAAAAAAAVuA/cqkiRY1OzMYuRItRUWNCczdiM0iFhFaTQCLcB/s1600/ayelet-shaked-2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="366" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-01FORKQQExA/WK_MN0nVeII/AAAAAAAAVuA/cqkiRY1OzMYuRItRUWNCczdiM0iFhFaTQCLcB/s400/ayelet-shaked-2.jpg" width="550" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: &quot;helvetica neue&quot; , &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: large;"><i>Ayelet Shaked: sleepless nights.</i></span></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><form action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post" style="text-align: justify;" target="_top"><div style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><input alt="PayPal - The safer, easier way to pay online!" border="0" name="submit" src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donateCC_LG.gif" type="image" />&nbsp;<img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/scr/pixel.gif" width="1" /></span></span></span></i></div></form></div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/SBfLZ/~4/QHXG3dvIO-w" height="1" width="1" alt=""/><div class="">
