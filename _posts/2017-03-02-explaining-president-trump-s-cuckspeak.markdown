If you were wondering why President Trump didn’t sound like himself last night, the answer is the two men behind him and the audience that was assembled before him.

Reminder: Congress is full of “normal Rs” and we need fewer of those people in 2018. Once again, they have unified control of the federal government and have almost nothing to show for it. Note: BTW, ‘Civil Rights Icon’ John Lewis boycotted his speech. Multiple Democrats wore white as part of protest for “women’s rights.” They also spent much of last night attacking Sen. Joe Manchin for not being as disrespectful as the rest of the Democratic Caucus.
