On this episode of This Alt-Right Life, I talk to Jason Kessler. Jason is a writer and journalist, a contributor to GotNews, and the author of the crime novel Badland Blues and the poetry collection Midnight Road. In the first segment, Jason and I discuss his fight against #BlackLivesMatter-supporting Charlottesville, Virginia Vice Mayor Wes Bellamy, his recall effort against Bellamy, how to strike back against anti-White politicians and academics, and much more.

In the second segment, Jason and I discuss his experiences at President Trump's inauguration and the Deploraball. We talk about the media's lies about the inauguration, practical strategies for pushing nationalist and alt-Right policies during Trump's presidency, the anti-SJW PAC he is forming to help advocate for these policies, and more.

This Alt-Right Life is presented by Chloe Luv and Davis Aurini. Intro song "The World is Changing" by Winglord, second segment intro song "Shadilay" by P.E.P.E.
