<div class="pf-content"><p><a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/02/19/dozens_fired_after_joining_day_without_immigrants_protests.html">Slate.com bellyaches</a> that more than 100 people were fired on a Day Without Immigrants because the immigrants we can’t do without didn’t understand that one can’t just walk off the job and expect to keep it.</p>
<blockquote><p>Eighteen of those who were fired worked at Bradley Coatings Inc., which had warned employees they would lose their jobs if they didn’t come to work. &#8220;Regretfully, and consistent with its prior communication to all its employees, BCI had no choice but to terminate these individuals,”<a href="http://www.abc2news.com/news/national/18-people-fired-after-participating-in-a-day-without-immigrants"> the company said in a statement</a>. “The reason these employees missed work — to engage in peaceful demonstrations — had nothing to do with BCI’s decision to terminate them.” Fired workers said they planned to make up the day on Sunday but the company didn’t budge.</p>
<p>In Lexington, South Carolina,<a href="http://www.wltx.com/news/21-people-fired-after-taking-part-in-a-day-without-immigrants/409472952"> 21 workers were fired</a> from Encore Boat Builders after they took part in the national protest. The company has declined to comment. And in Denver, at least 30 workers were fired from JVS Masonry after they missed work on Thursday. “I have no view on immigration laws or anything going on with that. All I know is I have a business to run,”<a href="http://kdvr.com/2017/02/18/local-workers-fired-for-taking-park-in-a-day-without-immigrants/"> company owner Jim Serowski said</a>.</p><!-- TAG START { player: "7518-804336-VDare - Outstream - Rev", owner: "ONE Video by AOL", for: "ONE Video by AOL" - BEINJS } --><div id="57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4" class="vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539">    <script type="text/javascript" src="//delivery.vidible.tv/jsonp/pid=57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4/56bcd17ce4b018167fea5539_bein.js"></script></div><!-- TAG END { date: 07/25/16 } --></blockquote>
<p>Precisely, the point. Employees just don’t get to take the day off to politick and announce they’ll “make it up” when they wish. At least not where I work. Serowski has a business to run. If his employees want to go on strike to prove a political point, they are welcome to do so. But not while working at his shop.</p>
<p>On another note, I hadn’t noticed the<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=day+without+immigrants&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8"> Day Without Immigrants</a> had passed.</p>
<p>Somehow, I survived.</p>
<p>If immigrants are so put out about real Americans trying stop more of them from wrecking the country, they are welcome to leave. Nothing much will change, except we won&#8217;t have to pay to incarcerate and educate them, or for their medical care.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/31/world/charles-m-lichenstein-75-american-envoy-at-the-un.html">To paraphrase the late Charles Lichenstein</a>, former No. 2 man at the US United Nations Mission, if immigrants believe “they are not being treated with the hostly consideration that is their due,” maybe they should think about “removing themselves and this organization from the soil of the United States.”</p>
<p>To put it more bluntly: “<a title="" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0BTdo6qGwo">Well, bye</a>.”</p>
