&lt;p&gt;Trump didn’t “grant himself” authority to step up deportations, it’s inherent in his role as head of the Executive Branch, enforcing the immigration laws.

&lt;p&gt;He pointed out that Eisenhower &lt;em&gt;didn`t have to pass any laws.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being an illegal alien was already illegal. All it took was for the President of the United States to decide that something should be done, and then do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast,  Obama granted himself sweeping authority to &lt;em&gt;stop &lt;/em&gt; deportations, something which was obviously illegal, and which we argued was impeachable. (See James Kirkpatrick’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vdare.com/articles/if-the-gop-leadership-believes-obamas-amnesty-is-unconstitutional-why-cant-they-even-consider-impeaching-him&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;If The GOP Leadership Believes Obama’s Amnesty Is Unconstitutional, Why Can’t They Even CONSIDER Impeaching Him?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Obama didn’t run on a promise to do that–he &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.speaker.gov/general/22-times-president-obama-said-he-couldn-t-ignore-or-create-his-own-immigration-law&quot;&gt;told illegals he wasn’t king&lt;/a&gt;, and couldn’t do that. Then he changed his mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump, by contrast, is keeping his election promise.&lt;/p&gt;
