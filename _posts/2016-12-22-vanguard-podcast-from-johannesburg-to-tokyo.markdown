The first "experimental" podcast that Alternative Right editors Andy Nowicki and Colin Liddell did with Richard Spencer. The topics include Mitt Romney's Presidential campaign, political life in Tokyo, South Africa, and why young people shouldn't become lawyers. (Originally uploaded 16th July, 2012)<div class="">
