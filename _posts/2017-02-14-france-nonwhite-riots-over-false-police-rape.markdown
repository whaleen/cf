In one of the attacks, the nonwhites deliberately set fire to a car that had at least two children inside-and it was only due to quick action by police and a passerby that the children were saved from the blaze. According to a report in the Le Monde newspaper, at least eleven nonwhites, including eight “minors,” were arrested on Sunday, February 12, following street violence and attacks on police in the heavily Arab- and African-populated area of Argenteuil, northwest of Paris.
