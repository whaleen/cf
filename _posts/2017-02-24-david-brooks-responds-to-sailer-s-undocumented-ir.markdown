<p>David Brooks FEB. 24, 2017</p>
<p><a id="xlink_1_3" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/#xlink_1_3" name="xlink_1_3"></a>A few weeks ago, Tom Cotton and David Perdue, Republican senators from Arkansas and Georgia, introduced an immigration bill that would cut the number of legal immigrants to this country each year in half, from about a million to about 500,000.</p>
<p><a id="xlink_1_4" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/#xlink_1_4" name="xlink_1_4"></a>In a press conference, Cotton offered a rationale for his bill. “There’s no denying this generation-long surge in low-skilled immigration has hurt blue-collar wages,” he said. If we can reduce the number of low-skill immigrants coming into the country, that will reduce the pool of labor, put upward pressure on wages and bring more Americans back into the labor force.</p>
<p><a id="xlink_1_5" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/#xlink_1_5" name="xlink_1_5"></a>It seems like a plausible argument. That is, until you actually get out in the real world.</p>
<p><a id="xlink_1_6" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/#xlink_1_6" name="xlink_1_6"></a>Cotton and Perdue’s position, which is now the mainstream Republican position, is based on the unconscious supposition that American society is like a <strong>lake</strong>, with a relatively fixed boundary. If you cut the supply of <strong>fish</strong> coming from outside, there will be more food for the ones born here.</p><div id="57966237cc52c74a5e1363c4" class="vdb_player vdb_57966237cc52c74a5e1363c456bcd17ce4b018167fea5539">    </div>
<p><a id="xlink_1_7" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/#xlink_1_7" name="xlink_1_7"></a>The problem is that American society is actually more like a <strong>river</strong>. Sometimes the <strong>river</strong> is <strong>running</strong> high, with a lot of <strong>volume</strong> and <strong>flow</strong>, with lots of good stuff for everybody, and sometimes it’s <strong>running</strong> low.</p>
<p><a id="xlink_1_8" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/#xlink_1_8" name="xlink_1_8"></a>Let’s illustrate the point by looking at one portion of the labor market. Right now construction is booming in many cities. This has created high demand for workers and pervasive labor shortages.</p>
<p><a id="xlink_1_9" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/#xlink_1_9" name="xlink_1_9"></a>Nationwide, there are now about 200,000 unfilled construction jobs, according to the National Association of Home Builders. If America were as simple as a <strong>lake</strong>, builders would just raise wages, incomes would rise and the problem would be over.</p>
<p><a id="xlink_1_10" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/#xlink_1_10" name="xlink_1_10"></a>But that hasn’t happened. …</p>
<p><a id="xlink_1_11" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/#xlink_1_11" name="xlink_1_11"></a>Employers have apparently decided raising wages won’t work. …</p>
<p><a id="xlink_1_12" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/#xlink_1_12" name="xlink_1_12"></a>In other words, the labor shortage hasn’t led to higher wages; it’s reduced and distorted the flow of the economic <strong>river</strong>. … When builders do have workers, they focus on high-end luxury homes, leaving affordable housing <strong>high</strong> and <strong>dry</strong>.</p>
<p><a id="xlink_1_13" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/#xlink_1_13" name="xlink_1_13"></a>The essential point is that immigrants don’t take native jobs on any sort of one-to-one basis. They drive economic activity all the way down the <strong>river </strong>…</p>
<p><a id="xlink_1_14" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/#xlink_1_14" name="xlink_1_14"></a>For the life of me, I can’t figure out why so many Republicans prefer a dying white America to a place like, say, Houston.</p>
<p><a id="xlink_1_15" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/#xlink_1_15" name="xlink_1_15"></a>Cotton and Perdue are the second coming of those static mind-set/slow-growth/zero-sum liberals one used to meet in the 1970s. They’ll <strong>dry</strong> up the <strong>river</strong>. …</p>
<p><a id="xlink_1_16" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/#xlink_1_16" name="xlink_1_16"></a>[Bold is mine.]</p></blockquote>
<p><a id="xlink_1_17" class="xlink" title="Anchor Link to This Paragraph" href="http://www.unz.com/isteve/#xlink_1_17" name="xlink_1_17"></a>Okay!</p>
