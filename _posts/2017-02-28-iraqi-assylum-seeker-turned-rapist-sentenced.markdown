<p>Ismael Omer, 32, preyed on the “clearly drunk” woman who had missed her last bus home.</p>
<p>Omer took her to his home in Notting Hill, West London, and raped her in a cramped basement, Southwark crown court was told.</p>
<p>When she fled and pressed charges he tried to exploit her memory loss and claimed she had made advances towards him.</p>
<p>But CCTV footage of the “vulnerable” complainant stumbling past a Ladbrokes betting shop and a McDonalds near his house revealed she wasn’t initiating any sexual activity.</p>
<p>He wept in the dock and hung his head in shame as he was jailed for five years at Southwark Crown Court.</p>
<p>Omer claimed asylum in the UK after being tortured by Saddam Hussain’s Baathist regime and cannot return because his hometown is now controlled by Islamic State fighters.</p>
<p>He denied the charge but was convicted of one count of rape following a trial at Southwark Crown Court.</p>
