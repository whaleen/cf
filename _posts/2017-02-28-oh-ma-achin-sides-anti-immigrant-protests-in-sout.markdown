<div dir="ltr">You know, these days it’s almost possible to feel a little sorry for the legacy media, <i>die Lugenpresse</i>. Take the <i>Guardian</i> (yes, please do). Its obese shrieking lesbians and their wispy-bearded virtue-signalling “male” counterparts can feel power slipping from the oily grasp. Already reeling from Trump and Brexit, their readership and credibility plummet while financial losses soar. Reality smacks them in the face every day and watching them pull their own teeth out is such fun. Take this<strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/24/south-african-police-use-force-anti-immigration-protest-pretoria"><i>Gruaniad</i> report</a></strong> from South Africa where that country’s African population riot against illegal immigration from other parts of Africa.</div>
<div dir="ltr">
<blockquote><p><i>South African police have used stun grenades, rubber bullets and water cannon to try to disperse anti-immigration protesters in the capital, Pretoria, and keep them from foreign nationals who had gathered to express alarm about recent attacks.</i></p>
<div>
<p><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Y9frHuoM53M/WLKbFNA5T3I/AAAAAAAAFyc/cblsvHcAz3M6S3NIz-zpbuULo0-iSF5HwCLcB/s1600/south%2Bafrica%2B2.jpg"><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Y9frHuoM53M/WLKbFNA5T3I/AAAAAAAAFyc/cblsvHcAz3M6S3NIz-zpbuULo0-iSF5HwCLcB/s200/south%2Bafrica%2B2.jpg" width="200" height="120" border="0"></a><i>A police official said 136 people had been arrested in the past 24 hours.</i></p>
<p>Resentment against foreign nationals has sometimes turned deadly amid accusations that they take jobs from locals in a country where unemployment is more than 25%. Others are blamed for drug-dealing and other crimes.</p>
<p>In 2015, anti-immigrant riots in and around the city of Durban left at least six people dead. About 60 people were killed in similar violence seven years earlier.</p>
<p>On Friday protesters in Pretoria marched towards the foreign ministry, some carrying sticks or pipes. A petition was handed to the ministry in which they suggested the government teach immigrants to “speak properly”. The petition added: “They are arrogant and they don’t know how to talk to people, especially Nigerians.”</p>

<p>Oh deary deary me. How can this be? Our favourite pets saying the very same things as White fascists.  It’s enough to make a Good White journalist choke on his/her/its tofu. Snowflakes melting in the African sun! As they stagger around, stupified, is there any chance that they’ll stumble on and report the <strong><a href="http://whitegenocideproject.com/whites-will-slaughtered-unless-give-land-south-africa-says-leading-politician/">real genocide</a> </strong>taking place in the Rainbow Nation?</p>
<p>Simple answer: No.</p>
